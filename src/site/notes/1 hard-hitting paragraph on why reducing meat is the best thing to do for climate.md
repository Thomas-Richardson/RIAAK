There is increasing evidence that eating less and meat and dairy is one of, if not _the_ biggest ways to reduce your impact on climate change. Animal products are responsible for 15% of greenhouse gas emissions, more than the transport sector. No positive diet changes [come remotely close](https://ourworldindata.org/less-meat-or-sustainable-meat) to being as good for the climate as eating less meat and dairy. It might be [impossible to stay under 1.5 degrees](https://www.independent.co.uk/climate-change/news/meat-climate-change-paris-agreement-vegetarian-b1621033.html) of warming without reducing meat. The good news is that plant-based meat alternatives often produce [30-90% less GHG emissions](https://gfi.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/GFI-Plant-Based-Meat-Fact-Sheet_Environmental-Comparison.pdf) than meat does.
