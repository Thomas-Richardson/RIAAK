LIME stands for **Library of Interventions for Meat Elimination**.  
In short, LIME is a continuously growing collection of all experimental studies that tested the effectiveness of a psychological intervention in reducing animal product consumption, improving attitudes towards animals, or changing related outcomes. This website was designed to make this literature more accessible to researchers, advocates, and policy makers.

At the core of LIME is a machine-readable, continuously growing database of intervention studies. For each study, information was extracted on:

- **Intervention mechanism** (e.g., presenting facts, menu design)  
- **Intervention content** (e.g., animal welfare, the environment)  
- **Outcome measure** (e.g., sales data, food diary)  
- **Participant sample** (e.g., sample size, country)  
- And much more

### Meta-analysis Tool
This tool allows you to synthesize the evidence across many studies. It enables you to:

- Specify which types of studies should be included in the analysis with the help of various filters  
- Estimate the average effect size across the included studies  
- Test for publication bias
