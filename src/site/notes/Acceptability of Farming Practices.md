A [2020](https://www.ciwf.org.uk/media/press-releases-statements/88-of-uk-public-think-cages-are-cruel-new-poll-reveals/) poll carried out by Compassion in World Farming and YouGov has found that 88% of the British public believe using cages in farming is cruel to farm animals. The survey, which was commissioned by Compassion in World Farming, Animal Equality, Four Paws, Humane Society International – Europe, WeMove Europe and World Animal Protection Netherland, also found that 77% support a complete ban on the use of cages in farming.

Respondents were given examples of factory farm practises which typically cause animals to experience pain or suffering as a means of producing affordable food.
