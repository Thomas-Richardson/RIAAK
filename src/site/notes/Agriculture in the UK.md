## Structure
- [DEFRAs 2024 report here](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/66e7e0b33f1299ce5d5c3ed9/Farming_evidence_pack_16sept24.pdf)
- Most livestock farms are solely owned or owner-occupied
	- as of 2022 [[Citations/World animal protection, 2024\|World animal protection, 2024]] estimate 133k total farms, 70k sole owned, 27k mixed tenure mostly owned and 16k mostly rented, 19k full rented
- But have contracts with large producers, such as multination meat produvers such as JBS, Cargill and Minerva, or supermarkets
	- [[Contract farming\|Contract farming]]
- Poultry is very highly vertically integrated: farmers produce the chickens but the big companies own the slaughterhouses, processing factories and sell the products to supermarkets
	- Many poultry farmers have vertically integrated contracts that means they receive feed and chicks and just have to raise them.
- Finishing farms are where the meat producer provides the young animals
- There are over 10,000 farms in the UK that keep pigs, but according to the Campaign to Protect Rural England (CPRE), approximately 92% of the UK’s pigs are kept on just 1,400 larger holdings with just 10 corporate companies accounting for 35% of the UK’s breeding sows.

## Who are the big players?
- See [[Citations/Sustain, 2024\|Sustain, 2024]]
- No Farmers No Food is a far right org
- Save British Farming is a more left org
## How do farms make money?
The business income of farms is typically made up of four key areas: agriculture, diversification, agri-environment, and the Single Payment Scheme. The latter 2 are [[Subsidies\|Subsidies]]

- Agriculture covers all costs and money generated through livestock or crops, what we might typically consider the business of farming.
- Diversification covers other activities which a farm might do to bring in income, including tourism, rents, or retail ventures.
- Agri-environment is mainly schemes which require farmers to manage their land in an environmentally beneficial way. Farmers taking part in these schemes can be compensated by the government for any income they have lost as a result, for example by planting woodland on their land.
- The Single Payment is a subsidy provided by the EU and distributed by the government to farmers. It made up most of the subsidy farmers received.

## The NFU
NFU represents the big ag companies rather than smaller farmers.

## [[Agriculture in the UK\|UK]]
See [[Citations/World animal protection, 2024\|World animal protection, 2024]] 
A mega-farm in the UK is roughly equivalent to a [Concentrated Animal Feeding Operation (CAFO)](https://plantbasednews.org/culture/film/film-north-carolina-pig-farming/) in the US:
- 2,500 or more pigs
- For dairy cows, the number is 700
- beef cows it’s 1,000
- At least 125,000 chickens raised for meat
- 82,000 “egg-laying” hens.
The UK had 1176 such farms in 2024
- Also in WAP report, between 2016 and 2021 the number of pig farms fell by 620 units but the pig population rose by 460,000 animals.
- According to CIWF, the UK saw a 20% rise in mega farms between 2016 and 2024
[[Citations/World animal protection, 2024#We don't know how many intensive dairy farms there are in the UK\|World animal protection, 2024#We don't know how many intensive dairy farms there are in the UK]]

[[Citations/World animal protection, 2024\|World animal protection, 2024]] calculate that the largest poultry unit in England in Shropshire has 1.48M birds

For cows it's growing: https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cy4ldkpz1klo 
### Other definitions
- We might define a UK factory farm as one requiring a permit under the [[Agriculture in the UK#ELMS\|EPR]]:
	- 40k poultry
	- 2k pigs for meat
	- 750 sows
- Problem is this defines it based on size but there are smaller ones that are worse for welfare
- Also has no definition for cows

This article discusses some of the [big agri](https://www.sustainweb.org/news/may23-intensive-livestock-directors-pay/) involved in the UK
