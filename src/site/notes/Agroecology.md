The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations (UN) is invested in agroecology as a sustainable and socially equitable alternative to industrialised farming practices.

central ecological features of agroecology:
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Recycling</mark> more recycling means agricultural production with lower economic and environmental costs.
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Efficiency</mark> innovative agroecological practices produce more using less external resources.
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Diversity</mark>: diversification is key to agroecological transitions to ensure food security and nutrition while conserving, protecting and enhancing natural resources.
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Resilience</mark>enhanced resilience of people, communities and ecosystems is key to sustainable food and agricultural systems.
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Synergies</mark> building synergies enhances key functions across food systems, supporting production and multiple ecosystem services.
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Co-creation of knowledge</mark>: agricultural innovations respond better to local challenges when they are co-created through participatory processes.
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Human and social values</mark>: protecting and improving rural livelihoods, equity and social well-being is essential for sustainable food and agricultural systems.
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Culture and food traditions</mark> by supporting healthy, diversified and culturally appropriate diets, agroecology contributes to food security and nutrition while maintaining the health of ecosystems.
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Responsible governance</mark> sustainable food and agriculture requires responsible and effective governance mechanisms at different scales â€“ from local to national to global.
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Circular and solidarity economy</mark> : circular and solidarity economies that reconnect producers and consumers provide innovative solutions for living within our planetary boundaries while ensuring the social foundation for inclusive and sustainable development.
