# Less effective things should be funded *less* but few things should not be funded
We are such a young movement, we don't really know with certainty what works and what doesn't. 

When it comes to allocating funding, we should never say that something should be allocated zero funding. If we don't think something is effective, we should just downgrade the funding, but we should never reduce the funding to zero, full stop.
