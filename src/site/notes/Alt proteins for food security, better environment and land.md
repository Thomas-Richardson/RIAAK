A GFI factsheet
## The World Bank (May 2024)
*Recipe for a Livable Planet: Achieving Net Zero Emissions in the Agrifood System* ([full report](https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/entities/publication/406c71a3-c13f-49cd-8f3f-a071715858fb); [1-pager](https://gfi.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/World-Bank-report-summary.pdf))

* Alternative proteins are ranked \#2 out of 26 food and agriculture-related interventions by GHG mitigation potential at 6.1 Gt/CO2eq per year, outranked only by afforestation/reforestation.  
* APs have nine times more mitigation potential than the second most promising intervention to improve meat production (improved ruminant feed digestibility, at 680 MtCO2eq per year).

**United Nations Environment Programme (Dec. 2023\) \-** 18 authors, incl. former IPCC chair Sir Robert Watson  
*What’s cooking: An assessment of the potential impacts of \[alternative proteins\]* ([full report](https://www.unep.org/resources/whats-cooking-assessment-potential-impacts-selected-novel-alternatives-conventional); [1-pager](http://gfi.org/unep)) 

* Finds that alternative proteins have climate, biodiversity, and global health benefits over conventional animal products.  
* Calls for govt. support for research and scaling, and international cooperation on both science and regulatory oversight.

## **Innovation Commission: Climate Change, Food Security, Agriculture (Dec. 2023\)**  
[*Innovation Case for COP28: Alternative proteins*](https://innovationcommission.uchicago.edu/research_briefs/alternative-proteins/) ([full report](https://innovationcommission.uchicago.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Alternative-Proteins.pdf); [1-pager](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hrvJ05zFAJsCe19t5yPyX2bIefBKBimGxpaM-UoAJqg/edit))

* Nobel Laureate in economics Michael Kremer’s commission at the University of Chicago finds that alternative proteins can: 1\) relieve food insecurity by lowering food prices; 2\) decrease direct climate emissions; 3\) alleviate malnutrition; & 4\) provide a more climate adaptive way of producing protein.  
* Governments and philanthropies should fund alt proteins research, to take advantage of all these benefits. 

## **The Center for Strategic & International Studies (May 2023\)**   
*Mitigating Risk and Capturing Opportunity: The Future of Alternative Proteins* ([full report](https://www.csis.org/analysis/mitigating-risk-and-capturing-opportunity-future-alternative-proteins); [1-pager](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1go7p0-5cj8bcoHqiSWuyK2HYr3HQIeKDXSa7qyNKuiE/edit))

* Finds that alternative proteins have climate, biodiversity, and global health benefits over conventional animal products.  
* Calls for the U.S. government to fund science and scaling, comparing alternative proteins to biopharma and advanced chips for artificial intelligence in terms of national security and economic benefits. 

## **Int’l Inst. for Applied Systems Analysis, *Nature Communications* (Sep. 2023\)**   
*Feeding climate & biodiversity goals with novel plant-based meat & milk alternatives* ([full paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-40899-2); [1-pager](http://gfi.org/naturecommunications))

* At 50% alternative proteins: 1\) 6.3 Gt CO2eq/year emissions reduction; 2\) global agricultural area, instead of expanding, declines by 12% (653 Mha of land released); 3\) water use declines by 10% (−291 km3) instead of increasing; 4\) reduction of forest and natural land almost fully halted.  
* “Our main results are based on conservative assumptions about processing and hence the benefits could be even higher if a more efficient processing scenario is realized.”

## **Global Methane Hub & ClimateWorks Foundation (Apr. 2023\)**  
*Global Innovation Needs Assessment: Food System Methane* ([full reports](https://www.climateworks.org/ginas-methane/); [1-pager](https://gfi.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/EXE23002-CWF_GMH_-Food-System-Methane-GINA_FINAL.pdf))

* Alternative protein investments from governments could generate $700b in GDP and 83 millions jobs. Across all agricultural methane interventions (food loss & waste; rice methane interventions; livestock interventions; and alternative proteins), 98% of the economic benefits and two-thirds of the jobs accrue to alternative proteins.  
* See also: [Climate Advisers (2023)](https://www.climateadvisers.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Climate-Advisers-Decoupling-Methane-Emissions-from-Meat-with-Alternative-Proteins-2023.pdf) (only alternative proteins have significant promise as an agricultural methane mitigation strategy on a global scale) & [PNAS (2022)](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2111294119) (reviewed 98 mitigation strategies across 430 peer review publications and found: 1\. Adoption barriers will likely prohibit livestock interventions from reaching their full technical potential; 2\. even at 100% adoption, increased consumption of ruminants will more than offset mitigation benefits).

## **ClimateWorks Foundation & UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (Nov. 2021\)**  
*Global Innovation Needs Assessment: Protein Diversification* ([full report](https://www.climateworks.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GINAs-Protein-Diversity.pdf); [1-pager](https://gfi.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Global-Innovation-Needs-Assessment-Summary.pdf))

* Governments will need to invest $4.4 billion/year in research and development and $5.7 billion/year in private sector incentives to reach 50 percent market penetration by 2050\. At this penetration, the mitigation potential of alternative proteins is 5 Gt/CO2eq per year by 2050, with a 5.5T economic value of this climate savings.
