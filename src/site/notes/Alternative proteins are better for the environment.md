## GHG emissions
According to Boston Consulting Group, at 11 percent market penetration, alternative proteins would have the climate mitigation impact of [totally decarbonizing air travel](https://www.bcg.com/publications/2022/combating-climate-crisis-with-alternative-protein)—and this doesn’t include the sequestration potential of land freed up by decreased grazing and feed crop production.

### PB Seafood
Plant-based alternatives have a greenhouse gas (GHG) footprint [one-third less](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fsufs.2020.00134/full) than conventionally farmed fish and [three-quarters](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fsufs.2020.00134/full) less than farmed crustaceans.
## Land
- Replacing processed meat and dairy with alternative proteins would reduce U.K. agricultural land use by 28% and 35% of agriculture emissions. ([[Citations/Green Alliance, 2023\|Citations/Green Alliance, 2023]])

## Processing
additional processing accounts for only 13%–26% of plant-based meat’s climate impact ([GFI, 2021](https://gfi.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/GFI-Plant-Based-Meat-Fact-Sheet_Environmental-Comparison.pdf)).

## Soil health
- Replacing meat with alt proteins diversifies the crops we produce which improves soil health
- Legumes are nitrogen fixing and that heals the soil

## Water
By only requiring the crops that end up in the final product, plant-based meat production cuts out feed crops, the primary water requirement in conventional meat production. Overall, plant-based meat production [requires up to 99 percent less water than its conventional counterparts](https://gfi.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/GFI-Plant-Based-Meat-Fact-Sheet_Environmental-Comparison.pdf). Likewise, cultivated meat production is projected to have massive blue water savings (water in freshwater lakes, rivers, and aquifers) with up to a 78 percent reduction as compared to beef production, according to [CE Delft’s recent life cycle analysis](https://gfi.org/blog/cultivated-meat-lca-tea/).

Studies show that plant-based meat could [reduce over 90 percent of eutrophying pollution](https://gfi.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/GFI-Plant-Based-Meat-Fact-Sheet_Environmental-Comparison.pdf) compared to conventional animal production. Cultivated meat [could reduce eutrophying pollution by 98 percent compared to conventional beef](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26383898/).
