Currently, the degradation of land and soils is affecting at least [3.2 billion people](https://ipbes.net/assessment-reports/ldr) – 40 per cent of the world’s population.

One review (Centeri, 2022[^2]) found that while grazing can have positive or negative effects based on a number of factors, overall research indicated that grazing is negative. Mainly due to overuse, grazing on sloping pasture lands can cause severe soil damage, the trampling can cause compaction, compaction decreases infiltration and thus increase runoff and, consequently, soil loss. 

A 2006 report found that livestock is responsible for an estimated 55% of erosion and sediment in the US[^1]

## Fertiliser
- Production of the high grade rock form of phosphorous is concentrated in just a handful of countries, and it is estimated that three quarters of the remaining reserve is in Morocco. 
- Nitrogen will never be scarce thanks to the [Haber Bosch process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haber_process), which enables us to make nitrogen out of thin air, but at considerable energy cost: it consumes around three to five per cent of the world’s annual natural gas output.

## UK
[Soils in every region in England](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/soil-nutrient-balances-for-the-regions-of-england-2020/soil-nutrient-balances-england-regions-2020#:~:text=Key%20points%20are%3A,seen%20in%20the%20North%20East.) are oversaturated with nitrogen and all but one has a surplus of phosphorus.
