#health_disease #factory_farming 

There are 4 primary but separate ways that animal agriculture contributes to disease:

1.  [[Factory farmed animals cause pandemics and zoonotic disease\|Zoonoses are where a disease jumps from animals to humans]]
	- [[Eating Our Way To The Next Pandemic\|Eating Our Way To The Next Pandemic]]
2. Working in or living near CAFOs can cause sickness due to unsanitary conditions
	- [[CAFOs injure and sicken their workers\|CAFOs injure and sicken their workers]]
	- [[CAFOs wreck domestic rural communities#Make local communities sicker\|CAFOs make rural communities sick]]
3. Outbreaks of animal disease decimates animal populations. 
	- This has no direct effect on human health but results in the deaths of millions of animals in months, and this can also have #food_security  and #economics implications.
	- [[Diseases in farm animals cause economic shocks\|Diseases in farm animals cause economic shocks]]
	- For animal disease outbreaks in asia, see [[Citations/Statharas and Zeng, 2023\|Statharas and Zeng, 2023]]
4. [[Antimicrobial resistance\|Antimicrobial resistance]]

Another minor one in developing countries is [[food bourne disease in LMICs from ASFs\|foodbourne disease]]
