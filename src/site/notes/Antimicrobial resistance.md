aka antibiotic resistance

- In the United States, over [66% of medically relevant antibiotics](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-6382/9/12/918) are used in animal agriculture. Intensive livestock consumes [four times the amount of antibiotics](https://ourworldindata.org/antibiotics-livestock) compared to livestock raised outdoors. However, the amount of antibiotics used in _different_ animals varies a lot. 
- 

## Different animals require different levels of antibiotics
One of the reasons why antibiotics are used in lower quantities in chickens is that they are killed at a much younger age. The fact that intensive livestock get far more antibiotics than animals raised outdoors is one reason why cows tend to get less antibiotics than pigs.

## How does it work?
Healthy animals are fed low doses of antibiotics to speed growth and prevent disease, causing bacteria to adapt and become resistant.

## Scale of the problem
- [[Citations/WAP, Alliance to save our antibiotics and The BIJ, 2022\|WAP, Alliance to save our antibiotics and The BIJ, 2022]] found antibiotic resistant superbugs in UK rivers downstream of factory farms.

## Solutions
- In many European countries, antibiotics today can only be administered with a prescription from a veterinarian.[7](https://ourworldindata.org/antibiotics-livestock#note-7) Vets are then given strict guidelines on how much and when they can be prescribed. Several countries — such as Denmark, Belgium, and France — have also imposed taxes or prohibited discounts on veterinary antibiotic sales, which reduces their incentives to prescribe them when they’re not essential.
- Pointing out that it doesn't negatively impact profitability One study found that antibiotic use on pig farms in the Netherlands fell by 54% between 2004 and 2016, without negative impacts on animal welfare or economic results (https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167587719306245&hl=en&sa=T&oi=gsb-ggp&ct=res&cd=0&d=5766918928476765157&ei=EApaZ5rsLdXEy9YP9oOM4Q4&scisig=AFWwaebF8lNDYNDDbEvCZkIu7jWJ).

If left unchecked, by 2050 drug-resistant microbes could kill 10 million people each year (more than currently die of cancer) and cause a cumulative $100 trillion in economic damage (as much as the global economic crisis of 2008–2009).

A study published in [*Science*](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abj1823) of the US supply of antibiotic-free beef found that fully [15 percent](https://www.consumerreports.org/health/no-antibiotic-claims-on-beef-may-not-be-reliable-a3433700667/) of the meat was from animals illegally fed drugs. New [evidence](https://civileats.com/2024/06/12/medically-important-antibiotics-are-still-being-used-to-fatten-up-pigs/) also suggests pork producers are using prohibited antibiotics.

[[Citations/Ardakani et al., 2023\|Ardakani et al., 2023]] find that factory farming uses 58% of antimicrobials given to livestock (seems small?)

A [2017 meta analysis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29387833/) found that limiting the antibiotics we give to farmed animals could cut AMR by 10-15%

Interestingly, in the US [only 2% of antibiotics](https://www.fda.gov/animal-veterinary/antimicrobial-resistance/2022-summary-report-antimicrobials-sold-or-distributed-use-food-producing-animals) are fed to chickens:

## EU and UK
- In 2022 the EU banned giving animals prophylactic or preventative antibiotics, however the [UK refused to ban it](https://www.sustainweb.org/news/may24-farm-antibiotics-legislation/) and implemented a weakened version, instead saying they could be used" in exceptional circumstances when there would be a risk of infection"
- new legislation was introduced in the UK on 17 May 2024 to restrict the use of antibiotics in farming [5]. The legislation prohibits using antibiotics to “compensate for poor hygiene, inadequate animal husbandry, or poor farm management practices”. Unfortunately, [none of the supermarkets](https://www.saveourantibiotics.org/news/press-release/alliance-publishes-new-report-on-supermarket-policies/) appear to have supply chains that are fully compliant with this new law.
