Aquatic plants are [protein-packed](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0308814624010094), [nutrient-dense](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0268005X24003862) foods that do not require arable land or fertilizer to grow.

key plants are duckweed, algae and seaweed

[A recent analysis](https://tos.org/oceanography/article/transforming-the-future-of-marine-aquaculture-a-circular-economy-approach) hypothesized that algae farms could produce all the protein the world will need in 2050.
## Companies
- Aquaculture startup [Sea&Believe](https://vegconomist.com/algae-microalgae-seaweed/aquaculture-startup-sea-believe-annouces-seaweed-farm-ireland/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=rasa_io&utm_campaign=newsletter) recently established its first seaweed farm in Connemara, Ireland. They claim their seaweed is 23% protein, higher than fish
- [Umaro Foods](https://www.umarofoods.com/) – is using red seaweed to make bacon and claims it might be able to produce for half the cost
- THIS use seaweed skin on their products

### Duckweed
- Duckweed is a small, floating aquatic plant that reproduces rapidly, forming dense colonies on the surface of ponds and slow-moving water bodies. Also known as water lentils or Lemna, duckweed is a nutrient-dense plant containing up to [45 percent high-quality protein](https://www.grains.k-state.edu/ccl/files/publication_pdf/2022_Food%20Res%20Int._Xu_Duckweed.pdf).
- [Sustainable Planet](https://www.foodnavigator.com/Article/2023/01/25/This-ticks-every-box-worth-ticking-The-agri-tech-start-up-aiming-to-grow-water-lentils-at-scale?bid=29988284&cid=DM1053703&utm_campaign=25-Jan-2023&utm_medium=email&utm_source=newsletter_daily#) is focused on utilizing desertified land to grow duckweed in a large-scale production process that allows the plant to be grown in saline water. The company is doing this in countries like Mozambique, using land that is otherwise unsuitable for agriculture and employing hundreds of smallholder farmers in the process.

## For jobs
- seaweed farming is a global economic opportunity. In [Tanzania](https://www.nature.org/en-us/what-we-do/our-insights/perspectives/restorative-aquaculture-seaweed-farms-tanzania/#:~:text=Seaweed%20farming%20is%20the%20third,percent%20of%20whom%20are%20women.), for example, it is the country’s third largest export, employing over 25,000 farmers—80 percent of whom are [women](https://www.globalseafood.org/advocate/for-seaweed-farmers-in-zanzibar-a-chance-for-real-growth/).
- startup [POSEIDONA](https://es.linkedin.com/company/poseidona?trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_little-mention) is using [an invasive, harmful species](https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/17/poseidona-seaweed-protein-food/?trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_little-text-block) of algae causing chaos off the coast of France and Spain to make protein. they hope to employ fisherman to collect it

## Funding
- The EU’s European Maritime and Fisheries Fund supported a €2 million “[Seafood Alg-ternative](https://cinea.ec.europa.eu/featured-projects/seafood-algternative_en)” project to develop seafood derived from microalgae and other sources.
