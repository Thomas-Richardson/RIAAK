While some products are lower in protein, iron, and B12, or higher in sugar and salt, PBAPAs consistently have lower levels of fat, including saturated fat and trans fatty acids, as well as lower cholesterol, higher fibre, and more vitamins and minerals compared to their animal-based counterparts.

This study[^1] found that replacing animal protein with plant protein reduces all cause mortality

- [[Citations/Espinosa et al., 2024\|Espinosa et al., 2024]] A systematic review says "mostly"
- However, [[Citations/Lindberg et al., 2024\|Lindberg et al., 2024]] notes that whilst 86% of PBMAs contained salt, 50% of the meat products did not. Why are we comparing meat alts to unseasoned meat?!
