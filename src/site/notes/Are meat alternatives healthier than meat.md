While some products are lower in protein, iron, and B12, or higher in sugar and salt, PBAPAs consistently have lower levels of fat, including saturated fat and trans fatty acids, as well as lower cholesterol, higher fibre, and more vitamins and minerals compared to their animal-based counterparts.

The UK government "*analyses* suggest that UPF categories, including meat and animal products and sweetened drinks, tend to be associated with an increased risk of adverse health outcomes. In contrast, UPF categories including vegetarian alternatives were not associated with adverse health outcomes.*"
# Reviews
- [[Citations/Espinosa et al., 2024\|Espinosa et al., 2024]] A systematic review
- However, [[Citations/Lindberg et al., 2024\|Lindberg et al., 2024]] notes that whilst 86% of PBMAs contained salt, 50% of the meat products did not. Why are we comparing meat alts to unseasoned meat?!
- [[Citations/Gouela et al., 2025\|Gouela et al., 2025]]: is the only review in my records that did not totally favour PBMAs
- [[Citations/Fernández-Rodríguez et al., 2025\|Fernández-Rodríguez et al., 2025]] suggets that PBMAs reduce bad and total cholesterol whilst not affecting good cholesterol
- [[Citations/Fernández-Fígares Jiménez et al., 2025\|Fernández-Fígares Jiménez et al., 2025]] review suggests they are healthier 
- [[Citations/Zaidi et al., 2025\|Zaidi et al., 2025]] Look into this

# Non-Review Studies
[[Citations/Cordova et al., 2023\|Cordova et al., 2023]] (267,000 people): ultra processed meats are assocated with negative health effects, ultra processed plant based proteins were not.
