#factory_farming 

How much does the UK public understand about factory farming?

Seems likely because [[Most people strongly support animal rights\|Most people strongly support animal rights]] quite dramatically

Interestingly there's a questionnaire developed by researcher on it: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09515089.2022.2056436

## #UK
- Pull in stuff from [[Citations/Bhattacharya, Bryant and Couture 2023\|Bhattacharya, Bryant and Couture 2023]]
- [[UK Consumer Attitudes Towards the Egg Industry\|Bryant found]] that only 41% of people know about male chick culling
- Check the raw data of: [[Acceptability of Common Farming Practices\|Acceptability of Common Farming Practices]]

[VFC](https://vfcfoods.com/survey-finds-consumers-kept-in-the-dark-about-factory-farming/) commissioned a survey of 5000 Brits in 2022 and found that less than 15 per cent of people knew that almost all chickens are factory farmed, while the majority of people thought that chickens were killed at 3-6 months old.

## Rest of the world
- [Most americans think](https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/aft-survey-2021) that their animal products come from animals that are treated well
- https://mercyforanimals.org/blog/shocking-new-study-finds-public-knows-nothing/
- https://www.aspca.org/protecting-farm-animals/aspca-surveys
- When asked if they knew much about the industrial meat industry, 52% of Thais said they knew a bit and 8% said they knew a lot. There will be exaggeration here though.
