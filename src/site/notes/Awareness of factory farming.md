How much does the UK public understand about factory farming?

Seems unlikely because [[Most people strongly support animal rights\|Most people strongly support animal rights]] quite dramatically

Interestingly there's a questionnaire developed by researcher on it: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09515089.2022.2056436 
- [ ] Look to see if anyone's actually used this scale 

Do some Google Trends stuff, see: [[People resist talking about factory farming\|People resist talking about factory farming]]
