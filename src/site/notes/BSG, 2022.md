1. **Market Growth of Alternative Proteins**: By 2035, alternative proteins are expected to capture 11% of the global protein market, potentially reaching 22% with technological and regulatory support. The market value could hit $290 billion.
3. **Climate Impact**: A shift to alternative proteins could reduce global CO2e emissions by 0.85 gigaton by 2030, equivalent to decarbonizing 95% of the aviation sector.
4. **Investment Trends**: Venture capital in alternative proteins grew from $1 billion in 2019 to $5 billion in 2021. Investment in fermentation-based and animal-cell-based technologies saw significant rises of 137% and 425%, respectively.
5. **Consumer Preferences**: 75% of consumers cite health as the main reason for adopting alternative proteins, but taste and price remain key factors. Over 30% of consumers would switch to alternative proteins for climate benefits.
6. **Economic Efficiency**: Investing in alternative proteins yields the highest CO2e savings per dollar compared to other sectors. The potential impact return on capital employed (IoCE) is estimated at $221 to $354 billion per trillion dollars invested, three times higher than other high-emitting sectors.
