#bryant_social_media_project 

Proposal: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1H9H4xsQIXJq_kj0RqO1tix5eymEfsAQzRGZrtMZLtwU/edit#heading=h.dj1hrm1jthvy

## Summary
We propose a study to test the impact of social media advertisements on consumption of meat and meat alternatives. We will combine precisely-targeted social media advertisements with proprietary retail scanner data on sales of meat and meat alternatives. This will allow us to run different types of advertisement campaigns in different regions, and compare sales of meat and alternatives in the regions we target vs. the rest of the country to test and demonstrate the impact of our social media campaigns. The results will support the funding and development of impactful social media campaigns to reduce meat consumption.
