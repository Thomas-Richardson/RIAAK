- What if public health advocates, who have long been frustrated with One Health being officially endorsed while being ignored in actual policy, worked in coordination with the nascent coalitions emerging between animal and climate groups?
- Vox "this is how factory farming ends" series is great for this.

## Orgs doing this work
- Vegans support the farmers
- FarmKind
- Plant based health professionals

## Misc notes to clean
- For decades, animal industries, including meat, dairy, and commercial fishing, have been working successfully to undermine democracy and government oversight in order to boost their bottom lines.
- No humans [have ever](https://theintercept.com/2019/03/23/ecoterrorism-fbi-animal-rights/) been killed as a result of animal activism
- To build a successful progressive movement, one that can challenge animal industriesâ€™ extraordinary corporate malfeasance, the left needs to resist this strategy of divide-and-conquer. By treating concern for non-human animals as a fringe issue, progressives may actually be undermining many of the causes they care about, while also inadvertently emboldening the right and abetting the further erosion of democracy, including attacks on the regulatory state.
	- For progressive movements to win, they need to incorporate animal rights. Expanding our circle of concern beyond our species will help progressives address many of the urgent challenges of our day, from tackling climate change and protecting public health to reining in corporate power and preserving civil liberties, because animal issues are invariably connected to all of these causes.
