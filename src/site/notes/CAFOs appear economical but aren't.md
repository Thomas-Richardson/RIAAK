## Reading
Over the years a number of farmers and advisors have mentioned that there seems to be an optimal size for farms. Costs go up in steps, so any economies of scale get lost when new infrastructure, technology and people are needed.

There is very good work from the Americas on this problem, and that would be a good starting point. These two papers are from AgEcon, which if you don't know it,Â  is a great repository for research. The MacDonald paper is really well argued (economies of scale need very certain conditions to be realised but are often not realised). Both papers are a little old but still valid.

## Main writing
CAFOs simply appear economical because they shift production costs to taxpayers and communities.

The economies of scale may be a lie, and even if they are true they are not passed to consumers.

[From 2016 onward](https://www.ers.usda.gov/amber-waves/2024/january/concentration-in-u-s-meatpacking-industry-and-how-it-affects-competition-and-cattle-prices/), the spread between cattle and beef prices has increased significantly, even as industry concentration remains high, indicating packers may now be able to increase their margins without passing on savings.
