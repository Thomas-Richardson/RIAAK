## Unsupplemented diets are insuffient
**_Natural_ vegan diets for infants** containing only plant foods without supplements **are not nutritionally complete** and are at least vitamin B12 deficient ([Vegan Health](https://veganhealth.org/vitamin-b12-plant-foods/), [Vegetarian Nutrition Dietetic Practice Group](https://vndpg.org/docs/rd-resources/B12-RD.pdf)) and can be also deficient in calcium, iodine, iron, zinc, vitamin D and protein ([EatRight, 2019](https://www.eatright.org/food/nutrition/vegetarian-and-special-diets/feeding-vegetarian-and-vegan-infants-and-toddlers), [Journal of American Dietetic Association, 1985](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3891829)).

## Use special formulae: don't just blindly give them any non dairy milk
<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Soy-based formula is a nutritionally adequate option for infants who can't be breastfed</mark> and for those with rare genetic diseases, such as lactase deficiency and galactosemia ([Pediatrics](https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/121/5/1062)). **Soy-protein based formulas** seem to be the only widely available vegan formulas for infants that are nutritionally complete. They are, at least in the US, **fortified** with certain amino acids, iron, iodine, calcium, zinc, vitamin B12 and D3 and other minerals and vitamins ([Pediatrics, 2008](https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/121/5/1062); [Frontiers in Nutrition, 2016](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5241282/?report=classic)), so all the essential nutrients in the usual amount ([1 liter or ~1,000 g](https://www.seattlechildrens.org/conditions/a-z/bottle-feeding-formula-questions/)) of a given [soy formula](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/336463/nutrients) should meet the [Recommended Dietary Allowances](http://nationalacademies.org/hmd/~/media/Files/Report%20Files/2019/DRI-Tables-2019/6_DRIValues_Summary.pdf?la=en) for infants.

Soy milk, rice milk, almond milk and homemade formulas are _not_ appropriate for babies during the first year because they have the wrong ratio of protein, fat and carbohydrates and do not contain sufficient amount of minerals and vitamins ([EatRight, 2019](https://www.eatright.org/food/nutrition/vegetarian-and-special-diets/feeding-vegetarian-and-vegan-infants-and-toddlers)).

## When breastfeeding, make sure you get enough B12
A mother who insists to remain vegan during breastfeeding needs to take vitamin B12 and, possibly, other supplements, as advised by a doctor, to prevent nutrient deficiencies in a baby ([CDC.gov](https://www.cdc.gov/breastfeeding/breastfeeding-special-circumstances/diet-and-micronutrients/maternal-diet.html)).

## What do nutritional authorities say?
Some nutrition authorities believe that a vegan diet is _not the most suitable_ option for infants:

> [Vegan Society](https://www.vegansociety.com/resources/nutrition-and-health/life-stages/under-fives): Exclusive breastfeeding is recommended for the first six months of your baby’s life. Soya-based infant formula can be fed to vegan infants when breastfeeding is not an option.
> 
> [German Nutrition Society (DGE), 2016](https://www.ernaehrungs-umschau.de/fileadmin/Ernaehrungs-Umschau/pdfs/pdf_2016/04_16/EU04_2016_Special_DGE_eng_final.pdf): DGE does not recommend a vegan diet for pregnant women, lactating women, infants, children or adolescents. Because of their content of phyto-oestrogens and the higher level of aluminium in comparison to infant formulas based on cows’ milk, infants who have not been breastfed (or only partially) should only be given soya products regularly in exceptional and justified cases (e.g. galactosaemia) and on medical recommendation.
> 
> [Federal Commission for Nutrition in Switzerland, 2018](https://www.eek.admin.ch/dam/eek/de/dokumente/publikation-und-dokumentation/EEK_vegan_report_final.docx.pdf.download.pdf/EEK_vegan_report_final.docx.pdf): Children and pregnant women are advised against adopting a vegan diet. If an infant cannot be breastfed, the only adequate vegan alternative is a soy-based methionine-fortified infant formula, as recommended by the ESPGHAN Committee on Nutrition. There are no formula options that do not contain animal products for those infants, who are intolerant to soy formula. A lack of data persists to know whether the nutritional requirements are covered and whether the development of children and adolescents fed with a vegan diet is secure.
> 
> [American Academy of Pediatrics, 2008](https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/121/5/1062): In term infants, although isolated soy protein-based formulas may be used to provide nutrition for normal growth and development, there are few indications for their use in place of cow milk-based formula. These indications include (a) for infants with galactosemia and hereditary lactase deficiency (rare) and (b) in situations in which a vegetarian diet is preferred...Soy protein-based formulas are not designed > for or recommended for preterm infants...The routine use of isolated soy > protein-based formula has no proven value in the prevention or management of > infantile colic or atopic disease.

Nutrition authorities who believe vegan diets can be appropriate for infants in general:

> [American Dietetic Association and Dietitians of Canada, 2003](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002822303002943): Well-planned vegan and other types of vegetarian diets are appropriate for all stages of the life cycle, including during pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence.
> 
> [Italian Society of Human Nutrition, 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0939475317302600?via%3Dihub): Vegetarian diets that include a wide variety of plant foods provide adequate nutrient intake for Italians of all ages. However, vitamin B12 intake may be low, so vitamin-fortified foods/B12 supplements are advised.
