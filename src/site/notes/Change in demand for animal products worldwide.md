## Globally on average meat consumption is increasing
The world now produces more than three times the quantity of meat as it did fifty years ago, with production rising fastest for #chickens ([[Citations/Ritchie et al., 2017\|Ritchie et al., 2017]])

The demand for meat in LMICs is expected to grow 80% by 2030 over 200% by 2050 [FAO (2018)](https://www.fao.org/3/i8384en/I8384EN.pdf)


## Demand for meat is falling in HICs on average

### The UK
[[Citations/Stewart et al., 2021\|Stewart et al., 2021]] detail declines in meat consumption in the UK between 2008 and 2019, broken down by meat type. The decline is being driven primarily by eating smaller portions of meat, and second by meat free days ([[Citations/Vonderschmidt et al., 2023\|Vonderschmidt et al., 2023]])
### But variance is increasing
While the average is going down this masks an increase in meat eating variance: NHANES data and [swiss data](https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/BFJ-07-2019-0499/full/html) indicate that the top 10% and bottom 10% of meat eaters have been eating more and less meat respectively. This unfortunately means that while vegetarianism in the U.S. has doubled in the past 20 years, Americans ate more red meat and poultry in 2022 than in any other year, 240 pounds per person.
