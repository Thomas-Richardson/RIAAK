### Key Takeaways

On average, respondents to the EAA Survey believe that:

*   The largest share (29%) of effective animal advocacy resources should be spent in Asia and the Pacific, followed by Western Europe, the U.S., Canada, Australia, and New Zealand (26%).
*   Farmed fish and farmed invertebrates received the highest allocations of resources among respondents (16.5% and 17.1%, respectively), shortly followed by egg-laying hens and broiler chickens (12.8% and 13.1%, respectively).
*   The plurality of resources should be spent targeting businesses (34%), followed by government institutions (28%).
*   Thereâ€™s about a 60% chance that an area that should receive over 20% of the EAA funding currently receives less than 5% of it.

In addition, a plurality of respondents believes that:

*   EAA needs more people who are experts on the developing world/populous-yet-neglected countries (17/25 votes), government and policy (16/25), and/or figuring out what matters most and setting priorities (13/25).
*   Their EAA organization is sometimes (9/25 votes) or often (10/25) funding-constrained and it is sometimes hard (11/25) to find outstanding candidates for roles.

When asked about issues facing the effective animal advocacy movement:

*   The lack of a strong evidence base (11/25 votes) and ability to appeal to the people most able to contribute to EAA cause areas (10/25) were the most commonly cited problems for EAA.
*   Epistemic uncertainty regarding interventions (10/25 votes) and a lack of influence over the public, donors, and others with power (10/25) were generally cited as the most pressing problems in EAA.
