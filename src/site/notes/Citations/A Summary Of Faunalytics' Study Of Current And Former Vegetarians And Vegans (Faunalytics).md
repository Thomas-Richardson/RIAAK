Our landmark study of lapsed and current vegetarians/vegans is an essential resource for animal advocates. Here we've compiled all of the related reports and resources in one place.

### Key Findings

*   **Prevalence & Lapse Rate**: 2% of the U.S. population (17+) is vegetarian or vegan, but 84% of them abandon their diet. 53% adhered to the diet for less than one year.
*   **Motivations**: The only motivation cited by a majority (58%) of *former* vegetarians/vegans was health. Current vegetarians/vegans cited multiple reasons, including health (69%), animal protection (68%), and environmental concern (59%).
*   **Reasons for Lapsing**: The main reasons for lapsing were dissatisfaction with food (32%), health (26%), social issues (13%), and inconvenience (13%). 63% of former vegetarians/vegans disliked that their diet made them stick out from the crowd.
*   **Post-Lapse Consumption**: Lapsed vegetarians/vegans eat less meat than the general U.S. population, consuming on average just over half the daily servings of meat.
*   **Interest in Returning**: More than a third (37%) of former vegetarians/vegans are interested in re-adopting the diet.
