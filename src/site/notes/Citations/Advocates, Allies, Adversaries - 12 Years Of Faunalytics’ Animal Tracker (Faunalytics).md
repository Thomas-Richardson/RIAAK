With hundreds of questions and thousands of respondents, we are proud to present our capstone analysis of the Animal Tracker survey of United States' animal attitudes.

This Animal Tracker dataset is rich with insights, but a few key takeaways are clear:

*   First, support for animals and their protection is high in the U.S., and has been for at least a decade.
*   Support for animal protection is not highly dependent on demographics. Despite the few small differences we noted, animal lovers clearly come from all backgrounds and walks of life.
*   Third, many people who support animal protection as a general idea haven’t fully integrated supporting animals into their lifestyle and politics. Those with less education were significant in this respect, but this was true across the board: Even with this inclusive definition of an Advocate, far more people were classified as Allies.
*   Finally, when it comes to animal advocacy, trust matters most. When people perceive animal protection groups as highly credible, it’s associated with support for animal protection across the board.
