## Abstract
Poor dietary quality is a leading contributor to mortality in the United States, and to most cardiovascular risk factors. By providing education on lifestyle changes and, specifically, dietary changes, hospitals have the opportunity to use the patient experience as a “teachable moment.” The food options provided to inpatients and outpatients can be a paradigm for patients to follow upon discharge from the hospital. There are hospitals in the United States that are showcasing novel ways to increase awareness of optimal dietary patterns and can serve as a model for hospitals nationwide.

# Notes
*   Poor dietary quality is the leading contributor to premature mortality in the United States, with dietary patterns low in plant-foods being a primary factor.
*   The report emphasizes that dietary patterns focusing on plant-based foods, as opposed to animal-derived products, are associated with significant reductions in cardiovascular risk.
*   In 2017, the American Medical Association (AMA) called on U.S. hospitals to improve patient, staff, and visitor health by providing plant-based meals and eliminating processed meats from menus.
*   The American College of Cardiology (ACC) has put forth similar standards, adding that plant-based meals should be actively offered and promoted within hospital settings.
*   Legislative action is supporting this shift; in 2018, California mandated the availability of plant-based meals for hospital patients.
*   The paper showcases several hospitals that have successfully implemented healthful nutrition programs by offering separate, 100% plant-based menus for inpatients.
*   Pioneering institutions mentioned include the University of Florida's Shands Hospital, Montefiore Health System (Bronx, NY), Northwell's Lenox Hill Hospital (New York, NY), and the Tampa Veterans Administration (VA) hospital.
*   Many hospitals are also introducing plant-forward options in outpatient settings and cafeterias, with programs like "Meatless Monday" being implemented at Montefiore and NYC Health + Hospitals/Bellevue.
*   These initiatives extend beyond menus to include educational programs, such as outpatient lifestyle medicine clinics, cooking classes, and partnerships with local farmers markets (e.g., Kaiser Permanente).
*   The report includes sample plant-based menus from hospitals, featuring dishes such as Tofu Scramble, Black Bean Burgers, Lentil Bolognese, and Tofu Vegetable Stir Fry as replacements for traditional meat-based options.
*   The core argument is that hospitals can use a patient's stay as a "teachable moment" to introduce and model healthful dietary changes that patients can continue after discharge.
