hospitals have the plant-based menu as part of their admission orders so ordering physicians are automatically obligated to bring diet into their admission conversation.

## NYC Health + Hospitals/Bellevue
#case_study 
A pilot outpatient program where patients work with a tveam of physicians, a dietitian, and a health coach to transition to a whole-foods, plant-based diet, increase physical activity, and learn stress-management techniques and sleep hygiene.

In the first 3 months since the program launched, early clinical successes include significant reductions in glycosylated hemoglobin, lipids, and body weight. Patients have also reported improved energy, sleep, and motivation to cook healthy meals at home. Anecdotally, patient satisfaction is high. At the time of writing it was undergoing formal review

## Kaiser Permanente
In 2003, Kaiser Permanente launched its first farmers market to re-introduce the concept of food as medicine. Today, the Kaiser Permanente network in Southern California boasts over 50 hospital- and clinic-related farmers markets. Locally, Kaiser Permanente Riverside Medical Center has removed sugar-sweetened beverages and deep fryers from its medical center and offers vegan and vegetarian options for inpatient and outpatient eating selections, along with daily healthy choices, salad bars, and a variety of fruits.

## Montefiore Health System
At Montefiore Health System in the Bronx, NY, the Cardiology Division has a plant-based prevention clinic that offers routine medical care in conjunction with intensive preventive counseling. As part of this initiative, the division offers free 4–5-hour long sessions on Saturday mornings, where a physician and a registered dietitian review plant-based nutrition in detail. The division encourages patients to come to the session with a friend or significant other who can support them in making this lifestyle change. In addition, at the meetings patients receive a plant-based meal, which is often the patients’ first introduction to plant-based foods. Montefiore also has a “Meatless Monday” option in their outpatient cafeterias.
