In 2023, the agri-food sector employed just under 4.4 million people, or 14% of all employees in Great Britain. This proportion has been broadly the same since 2001. Agriculture accounts for less than half a million employees or 10% of the agri-food sector.

In 2023 the value of food, feed and drink imports decreased by 8.8% to £61.1bn in real terms, resulting in <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">the trade gap in food, feed and drink of £36.7bn in real terms</mark>, a decrease of 7.1% since 2022.

## Self sufficiency in food

The food production to supply ratio (commonly referred to as the “self-sufficiency ratio”), is calculated as the farmgate value of raw food production divided by the value of raw food for human consumption and is estimated to be 62% for all food in 2023 and 75% of indigenous type food. The food production to supply ratio provides a very broad indicator of the ability of United Kingdom agriculture to meet consumer demand - also described as competitiveness. The ratio is not an appropriate measure of “food security”. In 2023, 58% of domestic consumption came from UK production (based on unprocessed value at farmgate), 24% from the EU and the remaining 18% from the rest of the world.
