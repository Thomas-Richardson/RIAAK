### Headline statistics

Alternative protein research is undergoing tremendous growth in Europe, with an **average year-on-year growth in funding over five years of 44%**.

Since 2020, when funding for alternative proteins across Europe totalled just over €80 million, the field has seen rapid expansion, to over €320 million allocated in 2024, a **296% increase**.

The **top three countries** leading the way in investing in alternative protein R&I in Europe between 2020-2024, are the **UK (€127 million)**, **Denmark (€126 million)** and the **Netherlands (€77 million)**. With €308 million invested since 2020, the **European Commission is the highest-funding jurisdiction**.

On a per capita basis, some smaller countries such as Denmark, Norway and Sweden significantly outperform their larger neighbours.

Funding has come from more than **67 independent funding bodies**, representing 22 countries across Europe, as well as global funders.

12 of these funders made their first investment into the field in 2024, suggesting a growing number of funders are exploring the area.

**Plant-based protein research** has received the most funding over the last five years (€444 million), but **fermentation research was the best-funded pillar in 2024** (with over €100 million awarded in that year alone) and has a higher rate of year-on-year growth over the entire period (77% compared to 27% for plant-based). **Cultivated meat** remains some way behind, with just €92 million of funding so far.
