For animal advocates, Brazil is a country of major opportunity but also major challenges. In a global context the scale of animal production in Brazil is immense. The dispersal of power between a range of different stakeholders in Brazil provides the animal advocacy movement with many avenues for impact. Nevertheless, Brazil also brings unique political and industrial challenges that need to be taken seriously.

The sheer scale of animal exploitation in Brazil means potential reforms, even for minority industries, are of great importance. However, there are challenges with what is politically and economically feasible, and this is a significant consideration for campaign selection. This does change based on the share of the farming industry’s production destined for the domestic or international market. So some routes for advocacy are likely to prove effective in some industries, but struggle in other settings. 

With this in mind, we have identified two main priority areas for reform at this time. Both of these tasks are high-priority and could potentially make extremely impactful campaigns.

1. **Cage-free enforcement and large scale retailer campaigns**. Cages remain one of the most widespread and cruel practices within the farming industry. There is clear scientific consensus that cage-free systems are “clearly superior to conventional cages and furnished cages even soon after a transition to cage-free environments”(1). Although, to date, there has been admirable progress, a significant amount of work remains to be done to ensure upcoming commitments are kept, and to hold large companies to account. 

2. **Screwworm elimination.** New World screwworm flies lay eggs in injured tissue, before the screwworm larvae proceed to feed on the infected areas. Screwworms are endemic in South America, affecting all warm blooded animals—including farmed cows, pigs, sheep and chickens. They cause devastating injuries and huge suffering, with mortality rates of 20 - 80% (2,3). By working with the Brazilia(2,3)n and other regional governments, it would be possible to eliminate the species entirely in the area, as has already been achieved in many areas such as North and Central America. 

We would like to highlight three other promising areas for reform, exploratory tilapia, shrimp and broiler welfare work. These are areas which warrant additional investment from the movement because the harm caused to the animals within these industries is extensive. However, at present, plans to work on the shrimp and tilapia, are not yet ready for full implementation. Groups beginning work in these areas will largely be laying the groundwork for future improvements. Likewise, progression within the area of broiler reform looks difficult given the power of the industry and potential interactions with ongoing cage-free campaigns. 

We also want to spotlight two underutilised approaches: a minor political party for animals and the use of popular initiatives. Both of which could allow the animal advocacy movement to utilise its strengths, gain popular support from the public (and intense support from a small subset of the population), and to place priority issues on the political agenda. 

Ultimately, these priorities should be selected and adapted, based on the political landscape at the time, and the position of the advocate or group. 

If you are interested in advocating for farmed animal welfare in Brazil and none of these campaign opportunities are suitable for your circumstances, then we please encourage you to reach out to Animal Ask. We have plenty of additional research concerning a wider variety of lower priority options which are still important.
