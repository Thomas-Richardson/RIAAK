From fish filets to ice cream, we have updated our impact scales to include additional nuances, better estimates, and updated statistics.

In September 2020, we published our Animal Product Impact Scales, outlining how many lives and days of suffering go into U.S. consumption of animal products each day. The purpose of this resource is to help a wide range of people prioritize animal product substitutes. Since then, it’s been used by nonprofit organizations, new alt protein start-ups, and individuals to make better choices about meat reduction.

With this data, which you can find on our updated hub page, you can see the impact of replacing specific animal products on both a national and individual level. In this blog post, we cover:

*   The updates we’ve made,
*   Our most frequently asked question about the results,
*   Some of the ways you can use this data, and
*   A brief overview of where the estimates come from.

We would also like to acknowledge and sincerely thank Clara Sanchez Garcia and Ali Ladak for volunteering many hours of their time for this project. We couldn’t have produced these resources without your support.
