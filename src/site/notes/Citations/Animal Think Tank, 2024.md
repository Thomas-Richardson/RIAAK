Representative sample of 2000 Brits

**one in four people** agreed with the statement: _"I would support a law which protected the rights of all animals in not being harmed, exploited or killed—even if it would mean that humans could no longer use animals for their meat, milk, eggs, or other body parts."_

Similarly, **45%** of participants agreed with the statement: _"It would be better if society did eventually stop using animals for human benefit altogether (e.g. food, entertainment, clothing)."_

When participants read stories where individuals shared their own experiences and transformative journeys toward understanding animal freedom, their attitudes shifted significantly. **These stories led to an average 6.18% increase in support for abolition, with some messages boosting support by as much as 14%.**

Participants were more likely to see animal freedom and rights as a natural continuation of social progress, boosting support for ending harmful practices against animals by up to 12.7%.

When people were reminded of animals' abilities—like solving puzzles, forming bonds that last a lifetime, mourning the death of their loved ones—they were up to 10% more likely to support abolition compared to those who didn't encounter such messages.

This research shows that **moving people beyond an animal welfare/cruelty frame** (i.e. that harming animals is wrong and animals suffer immensely) **and into an animal abilities/thriving frame** (i.e. that other animals are unique individuals, that we share many similarities and values, that we should all have the freedom to thrive etc.) can increase support for ending the exploitation of animals.

An animal abilities narrative also helps frame the narrative of ‘a good life’ in a way that challenges a welfarist interpretation of it - a narrative which the industry has heavily co-opted. **This shows real potential for us reclaiming the narrative of ‘a good life’ on our own terms** that is truly reflective of what our animal cousins want and desire.

But bear in mind that Animal Think Tank’s research so far indicates that while linking animal freedom to other human freedoms in a social progress context can be beneficial, directly comparing animal exploitation to other human struggles - and particularly comparing speciesism to other harmful -isms like racism and sexism - can have backfire effects that reduces support for our issue. So we need to take care when making comparisons/linkages with other movements and issues.
