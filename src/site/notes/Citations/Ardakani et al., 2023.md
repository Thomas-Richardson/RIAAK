Ardakani, Z., Canali, M., Aragrande, M., Balzani, A., & Beber, C. L. Global Public Health Cost of Antimicrobial Resistance Related to Antibiotic Use on Factory Farms.

The global average consumption of antibiotics in livestock production was calculated as 80,541 tonnes of active principles, of which 47,156 tonnes or 58.5% in factory farms.

more than 80% of total livestock AMU was for non-therapeutic purposes (metaphylaxis, prophylaxis, and AGPs).

For comparison, according to a WHO report, in
2015, 65 countries gathering 22.5% of the world's
population, consumed 14,256 tons of antibiotic
active principles for human health care.
Based on existing data, the average human AMU at
the global level grew at an annual rate of 1.7%
between 2000 and 2020, from 5,769 to 8,290 DDDs
per year per 1,000 individuals

in 2019, resistant
infections from the four examined bacteria globally
caused 403,000 deaths attributable to AMR (i.e.,
compared to a scenario where all drug-resistant
infections are replaced by drug-susceptible
infections) 13.65 million DALYs attributable to AMR

The estimated
global incidence per 1 million people resulted in
49.4 deaths and 1,730.3 DALYs attributable to AMR

The contribution of factory farming to this
burden was in 975,000 deaths and 33.5 million
DALYs associated with AMR. Based on the global
GDP per capita, we calculated that the economic
value of global productivity losses from the
population affected by resistant infections related
to livestock production was at 648.37 billion US$.
Factory farmsâ€™ contribution amounted to 382.54
billion US$, corresponding to 0.43% of the global
GDP
