***

As Asia covers a broad range of countries with different socioeconomic conditions, it is no surprise that the challenges local FAW/vegan organisations face are also diverse. Nonetheless, from this research, we can see some common barriers/needs:

*   General low public awareness of farmed animal welfare and plant-based diets as an important issue for health, animals and environment
*   General low favourability for a career in non-profit work
*   Lack of local donors concerned about this issue
*   Demand (from organisations) for more locally-relevant training on best practices for engaging stakeholders like corporates, government and the public
*   Lack of support for “non direct work” tasks like operations, finance, HR etc.

In this report, we outlined some ideas capacity builders and donors should consider implementing, and the ideas themselves range from short-term possibilities (e.g. developing direct work training programmes on topics such as corporate outreach, working with capacity builders to offer individual project incubation grants), to mid-term (e.g. developing outsourced support systems for operational tasks), and long-term (e.g. cultivation of local donor network).
