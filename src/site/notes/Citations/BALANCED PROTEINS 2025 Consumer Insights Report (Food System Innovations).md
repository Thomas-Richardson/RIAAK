### EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

#### CONCEPTS TO GROW THE BALANCED PROTEIN CATEGORY

**FOOD DECISION TABLE STAKES**

**Taste Rules**
Taste remains the ultimate factor in food decisions. While Balanced Protein products have demonstrated the ability to meet consumer expectations for flavor, skepticism toward new products persists. Overcoming this barrier is essential to ensure initial acceptance and long-term success.

**Price Governs**
Price shapes the consumer's consideration set for food purchases. With affordability driving behaviors like reduced meat consumption, the Balanced Protein category can differentiate itself by leveraging the cost benefits and perceived affordability halo of plant-based ingredients. However, price sensitivities and value perceptions are more acute for novel products.

**Functionality Focuses**
Consumers seek food products that serve multiple functional needs, such as health, convenience, and variety. Younger generations, in particular, prioritize these benefits as well as other altruistic attributes such as sustainability. Highlighting the functional benefits of Balanced Proteins can set the category apart from competitors.

**Familiarity Guides**
Consumers often rely on familiarity when making food choices, which presents a challenge for novel products like Balanced Proteins. To gain broad acceptance, the category must use effective design principles and strategic framing to convey familiarity while tactfully introducing its unique benefits.

**NEW JOBS TO BE DONE**

**Potential Targets**
Balanced Proteins have strong potential to appeal to diverse consumer segments by addressing unique motivations within key demographic groups. Younger generations are drawn to their functionality and sustainability, parents of young children value their health and convenience, and those actively reducing meat consumption see them as a healthier and potentially more affordable option.

**Gaps in the Meat Perceptions**
Meat is widely valued as nutritious and satisfying, with each product format offering unique strengths and weaknesses. Balanced Proteins present an opportunity to address specific gaps in consumers' perceptions without compromising what consumers love about meat.

**Overcoming Ingredient Concerns**
Novel meat products often face increased scrutiny over ingredients and production methods. By emphasizing functional benefits like satiety, energy, and convenience, Balanced Proteins can move beyond ingredient concerns and build trust with consumers.

**Believable Best-of-Both**
Traditional meat delivers immediate rewards like taste and energy, while vegetables offer long-term benefits like health and longevity. The Balanced Protein category must deliver on the experience of meat while introducing credible, plant-derived functional advantages.

**GO-TO-MARKET WATCHOUTS**

**The Novelty Trap**
Novelty or curiosity can help to drive initial trials from early adopters, but these motivators are insufficient for repeat purchases. Balanced Proteins must provide enduring value through consistent taste, price, and functional benefits to build sustained purchases and loyalty.

**Distracting Claims**
While motivating for some early adopters, claims tied to the environment or animal welfare can alienate broader audiences. The category narrative should focus on tangible benefits like taste, affordability, and functionality to resonate with a wider consumer base and avoid politically charged messaging.

#### STRATEGIC INSIGHTS

**BUSINESS STRATEGY**

**Find Your Whitespace**
It is easier to solve an existing consumer problem rather than a created one. Check your assumptions, and clearly understand consumer perceptions regarding the existing competition. Find your product opportunity based on consumer needs and desires.

**Fit Into the Category to Redefine It**
These products must be seen as approachable while also capturing consumer interest. Find your balance between being a familiar part of the broader meat category while delivering delicious, differentiated value propositions derived from plant-based ingredients.

**Stay Focused on What Drives Choice**
With so many potential purchase drivers in this category, it's easy to lose focus. Don't let the pursuit of perfect clean labels or niche positioning overshadow the fundamentals—taste, value, functionality, and familiarity.

**PRODUCT**

**Leverage Consumer Sensory Insights**
As an emerging category, these products must meet the highest taste standards to establish a strong foundation for success. Engage consumers early and often to develop a clear, realistic understanding of their taste perceptions and preferences.

**Tailor Formats to Consumer Needs**
Don't underestimate the power of format innovation. Experiment with product formats that break down key barriers—like smaller pack sizes for easy trial or family-friendly options for shared meals—to improve accessibility and appeal while maintaining familiarity.

**SALES & MARKETING**

**Make it Relevant**
Consumers need to know why these products should exist in their diets and feel comfortable making a change. Create emotional connections, engage key decision-makers, and clearly communicate the product's unique value while avoiding sole reliance on short-term purchase drives.

**Lower the Barriers to Trial**
Trying something new requires effort. Address key friction points—such as taste skepticism and price sensitivity—to make trying and switching easier for consumers.

**Measure Long-Term Results**
A new category with new benefits requires sustained communication. Prioritize long-term brand building and consumer education to drive lasting adoption.
