## Executive summary

**Purpose and scope.** The paper diagnoses legal, policy, and institutional barriers that lock South Africa into intensive animal agriculture and proposes legal levers to shift towards plant-based and other alternative proteins. Focus is on large-scale, industrialised terrestrial farming of cows, pigs, and chickens; wild animal farming, aquaculture, insects, pet-food chains, and non-food animal uses are out of scope. The lens is explicitly animal-law centric while recognising human rights, environmental, and social-justice intersections.

**Methods.** Mixed-methods: literature review, key-informant interviews (contacted 100+ stakeholders across NGOs, industry, retailers, academics, government), and a public survey on consumption patterns and perceptions of animal vs alternative proteins.

## Diagnosis: why the current system is failing

- **Constitutional gap vs reality.** Despite constitutional rights to sufficient food and water, 2018–2020 estimates show 44.9% of the population in moderate/severe food insecurity (26.3m people), 11.3m severely food insecure, 23.2% stunting in under-5s, and very high obesity among adults; over 1 billion animals are raised and killed annually.
    
- **Environmental burden.** Livestock’s contribution to GHGs is material (FAO ~18%); SA cattle emitted ~35.37 Mt CO2e in 2019, with 64.5% from enteric methane; commercial beef alone accounts for ~50% of SA cattle emissions. The food system more broadly is a major emitter and water user.
    
- **Animal welfare and social-justice harms.** Intensive systems entail confinement, routine mutilations (beak/tail/horn removal, often without anaesthesia), poor housing and water access, and pollution externalities with gendered and community-level impacts. Worker mental health and zoonotic risks are concerns.
    
- **Regulatory fragmentation.** Relevant rules are scattered across domains and departments; implementation and coordination are weak, limiting effective protection of animals, people, and the environment.

## What the research surfaced

- **Barriers to shifting diets/markets.** Cost, access, awareness, cultural norms, stigma around plant-based products, and active industry messaging impede uptake. Government fiscal tools can tilt relative prices; distribution to low-income and rural areas is a gap.
    
- **Public understanding.** Availability of alternatives is improving but shelf space is small; knowledge of farming practices and animal-welfare issues is inconsistent, pointing to the need for education.
    
- **Policy flashpoint: meat-analogue labelling.** In June 2022 the Executive Officer for Agricultural Product Standards warned processors/retailers that using reserved processed-meat names on analogues is “illicit,” threatened seizures via the designated agency, and framed misuse as a criminal offence; a stakeholder meeting confirmed immediate enforcement while promising separate future regulations. Industry split: SAMPA welcomed enforcement; 53 plant-based actors sought withdrawal and contemplated legal action.

## Legal levers and reform directions

**Overarching recommendation.** Develop a single, comprehensive food-system law to encourage plant-based protein and reduce dependence on animal-based protein, anchored in constitutional rights.

**Leverage across legal domains.** Administrative, environmental, consumer-protection, criminal, corporate, competition, tax, property, nuisance, international, and comparative law each provide actionable tools to challenge the status quo and support a protein transition.

**Specific proposals (illustrative).**

- **Animal-welfare regulation and enforcement:** phase-out inherently cruel practices; promulgate species-specific binding standards; expand monitoring/enforcement powers beyond SPCAs; require welfare authorisations for new or expanding CAFOs; transparency through cameras and public M&E records.
    
- **Governance architecture:** separate animal-use promotion from animal-welfare enforcement across departments; strengthen inter-departmental coordination.
    
- **Government’s own procurement and catering:** lead by example; reduce meat served at government functions; align with EAT-Lancet-style dietary guidance.
    
- **Social and nutrition policy:** include alternatives in social-welfare programmes and bulk-buy consumer groups; update dietary guidelines and pyramids; school-level education on climate/health impacts; public education on harms and on alternatives.
    
- **Transparency and participation:** mandate public-interest reporting and open policy rationales; ensure inclusive public participation, especially for vulnerable groups.
    
- **Strategic litigation:** explore constitutional/administrative challenges (e.g., to DALRRD communique) as part of a broader reform strategy.

## Implications

- **For policy.** A coordinated, rights-based food-system statute could internalise externalities, harmonise fragmented rules, and enable price and information signals that favour lower-impact proteins.
    
- **For advocates and industry.** Priorities include pricing and access (fiscal measures, retail space, rural availability), consumer education, and proactive engagement on labelling standards to avoid de facto market barriers.

## Next steps in the project

ALRSA plans a White Paper incorporating stakeholder input, alongside monitoring of DALRRD’s meat-analogue actions and other legislative files (e.g., live-export guidance, aquaculture bill, conservation White Paper).

### One-line takeaway

South Africa’s intensive animal-agriculture model infringes constitutional interests and imposes unpriced social-ecological costs; a comprehensive, rights-anchored legal overhaul—paired with fiscal, informational, and governance reforms—can accelerate an equitable protein transition.
