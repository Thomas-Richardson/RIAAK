In this report we make the case for a global shift towards more sustainable and healthier diets. Using the latest and most well-evidenced behavioural science, we have outlined **12 strategies for promoting sustainable diets**. Each strategy offers a route through which governments, retailers, producers, restaurants, campaigners and consumers can help deliver a more sustainable food system. The strategies are: 

1. Incentivise product innovation and reformulation (e.g. through a carbon tax)
2. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Market plant-based food as aspirational, delicious, and indulgent</mark>
3. Use novel in-store/in-app promotions, incentives and games
4. Campaign with pride, positivity, and pragmatism
5. Raise awareness, and build a mandate for strong policy
6. Publicise the desirable norm, and lead by example
7. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">‘Re-brand’ plant-based food towards a mainstream identity, and promote more mainstream dishes</mark>
8. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Integrate (don’t segregate) the plant-based produce</mark>
9. Eco-labels and supermarket ratings
10. Ease the change with ‘rules of thumb’, tips and recipes
11. Prompt sustainable choices at timely moments
12. Edit the choice architecture, to make sustainable options more prevalent, more prominent, and the default choice
