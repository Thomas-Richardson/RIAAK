A very thorough review on PB defaults. Bjorn says he reckons it contains about 90% of the papers on the topic

"Instituting a PBD option in dining halls (in which meat was present but had to be specifically requested) was a slam dunk. Across several studies, as shown in the graph below, these programs massively increased the portion of veg meals ordered and eaten: of the well-executed PBDs, the percentage of vegan or vegetarian options jumped from an average of 17.2% to an average of 72.5%, or 55 percentage pointsâ€”more than quadrupling the baseline percentage! While writing this overview, we were unable to find evidence of an appropriately executed plant-based default program that failed to reduce the amount of meat consumed. In other words, **this works**."
