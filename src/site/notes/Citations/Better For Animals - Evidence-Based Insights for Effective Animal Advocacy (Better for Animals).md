Welcome to Better for Animals: Evidence-Based Insights for Effective Animal Advocacy. This resource is designed to be an extensive and dynamic overview of the state of the empirical evidence for the 27 different intervention types in ACEâ€™s [Menu of Interventions](https://animalcharityevaluators.org/research/methodology/menu-of-interventions/#:~:text=Menu%20of%20Interventions,defining%20and%20evaluating%20their%20work.). We created this project to sharpen our own grantmaking and recommendation decisions, and to provide a valuable resource for the wider animal advocacy movement. This is a living document that we will update several times a year based on community feedback and new evidence. It has not been copy edited and there may still be mistakes; please see the [Feedback](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O0ylEEQJMQMTBlHDHcNZwvTgifi7TNyd6GpabC_4VT0/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.mv5hij9o3i86) section if you would like to provide any suggestions for improvement.
