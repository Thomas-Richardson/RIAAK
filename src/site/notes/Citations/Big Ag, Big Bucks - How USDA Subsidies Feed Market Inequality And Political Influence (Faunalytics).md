This Faunalytics report dives into the murky world of USDA subsidies, where multimillion-dollar grants create an uneven playing field, supporting already massive animal agriculture enterprises with taxpayer money.

### Takeaways

Subsidies claim to be about protecting the little guy and encouraging competition, but because of a vicious cycle created by the interplay between grants and political influence, the exact opposite tends to be true. Heavily subsidized companies like Riverbend Meats, Cattlemen’s Heritage Beef Company, Prestage Farms, and Greater Omaha Packing Company — and their politically connected leadership — can pay off politicians to make sure the rules remain in their favor. This concentration of power stifles competition, harms consumers with higher prices and lower quality, and undermines the livelihood of smaller farmers.

Small farmers aren’t the only losers in this system either: animals lose when workers have no say over how the animals are raised because of the tight grip of giant companies over the meatpacking industry; the environment loses when small farmers are forced to monocrop and only plant subsidized crops, rather than crops most suited to their environment or most needed in the market; taxpayers lose when we ultimately have to foot the bill twice — first through the subsidies that disproportionately favor large agribusinesses and second through the higher prices the large agribusinesses ultimately create.

Not only do USDA grants fail to promote competition like they claim, they go a step further in that they actively shape the industry so those at the top stay at the top and those at the bottom can’t compete on a level playing field. Understanding this dynamic is crucial for advocating for policies that genuinely support animal welfare, sustainable agriculture, and fairness — both in the competitive landscape and in keeping prices down for consumers.
