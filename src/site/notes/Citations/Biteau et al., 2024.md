Biteau, C., Bry-Chevalier, T., Crummett, D., Ryba, R., & Jules, M. S. (2024). Is turning food waste into insect feed an uphill climb? A review of persistent challenges.

## Abstract

A significant challenge within our present food system is the vast quantity of food that is wasted. Insect farming has emerged as a potential solution, providing a means to convert waste into valuable agricultural resources, such as livestock and [aquaculture feed](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/aquaculture-feeds "Learn more about aquaculture feed from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"). 

- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Through a literature review and publicly available data from companies in the sector</mark>, we examine the types of materials currently used to raise insects at commercial scales, and analyse whether those materials compete with conventional animal [agriculture](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/agricultural-science "Learn more about agriculture from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") or other economic sectors. 
- While the idea of turning trash into treasure for insect agriculture may be appealing in theory, the reality appears to be more challenging. 
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Only some species of insects can be farmed using food waste</mark>, while others perform poorly. 
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">The inconsistent availability and quality of food waste pose significant obstacles to the establishment of large-scale insect farms</mark> aimed at consistently yielding high-quality products. Consequently, <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">insect-farming companies often resort to utilising high-quality feeds already in demand by other sectors</mark>. 
	- Moreover, <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">competition intensifies for the limited pool of food waste suitable for insect agriculture</mark>, as various industries, including agriculture, aquaculture, [pet food](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/pet-foods "Learn more about pet food from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") production, and [biogas](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/biogas "Learn more about biogas from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") manufacturing, vie for the same resources. 
	- Additionally, concerns regarding food safety due to contamination risks constrain the types of food waste viable for insect cultivation. 
- Realising the potential of food waste in insect agriculture necessitates substantial logistical investments, particularly given the decentralised nature of household and municipal waste management systems. Overall, turning food waste into insect feed [faces](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/face "Learn more about faces from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") a range of persistent challenges that makes the widespread use of insects in addressing food waste an uphill climb.
