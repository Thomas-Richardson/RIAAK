Bunge, A. C., Mazac, R., Clark, M., Wood, A., & Gordon, L. (2024). Sustainability benefits of transitioning from current diets to plant-based alternatives or whole-food diets in Sweden. Nature Communications, 15(1), 951. [https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-45328-6](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-45328-6)

Plant-based alternatives (PBAs) are increasingly becoming part of diets. Here, <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">we investigate the environmental, nutritional, and economic implications of replacing animal-source foods (ASFs) with PBAs or whole foods (WFs) in the Swedish diet</mark>. Utilising two functional units (mass and energy), <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">we model vegan, vegetarian, and flexitarian scenarios</mark>, each based on PBAs or WFs. 

Our results demonstrate that PBA-rich diets substantially reduce:
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">greenhouse gas emissions (30–52%)</mark>
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">land use (20–45%)</mark>
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">freshwater use (14–27%)</mark>
	- [[Animal agriculture uses lots of water\|Animal agriculture uses lots of water]]
with the vegan diet showing the highest reduction potential. We observe comparable environmental benefits when ASFs are replaced with WFs, underscoring the need to reduce ASF consumption. 

<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">PBA scenarios meet most Nordic Nutrition Recommendations, except for vitamin B12, vitamin D and selenium, while enhancing iron, magnesium, folate, and fibre supply and decreasing saturated fat. </mark>

<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Daily food expenditure slightly increases in the PBA scenarios (3–5%) and decreases in the WF scenarios (4–17%), with PBA diets being 10–20% more expensive than WF diets.</mark> Here we show, that replacing ASFs with PBAs can reduce the environmental impact of current Swedish diets while meeting most nutritional recommendations, but slightly increases food expenditure. We recommend prioritising ASF reduction and diversifying WFs and healthier PBAs to accommodate diverse consumer preferences during dietary transitions.

Nutrient content increased for iron (15–47%), fibre (36–163%), folate (13–160%), magnesium (13–147%) and polyunsaturated fats (26–92%) and decreased for saturated fats (13–38%) in all the six scenario diets compared to the BAU. Protein and zinc intake met and exceeded dietary recommendations in all six scenario diets with no protein or zinc deficiency risk.
