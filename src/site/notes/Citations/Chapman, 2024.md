## Processing the discourse over plant-based meat

Urges nutrition scientists to stop using the term “ultra processed” when describing vegan meat alternatives.

the report takes aim at how language around UPFs “is approaching a point of hysteria, has become worryingly detached from nutrition science and is at odds with health and sustainability goals.”

Its use of the “ultra-processed” label to discredit vegan foods is a potent example. Through [misinformation](https://plantbasednews.org/news/social-media/misinformation-against-plant-based-diets-social-media/) and simplification, a dangerous stereotype has taken root, the report notes.

“Despite significant limitations of the subjective definition of “ultra-processed food”, attempts have been made to conduct studies into health using it. This has, quite understandably, resulted in widespread confusion both within and outside the nutrition science community,” said Chapman.

In the report, Chapman suggests a series of actions to clarify messaging around healthy and sustainable foods.

These include training chefs in plant-based cooking, promoting plant-based meat in the media, and funding research to make vegan alternatives more affordable. Education aimed at schools could also help improve understanding of sustainable diets.

One challenge to overcome is the powerful interests of the meat and dairy industries. Last month, the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board (AHDB) launched a [new campaign aimed at promoting meat and dairy](https://plantbasednews.org/news/environment/meat-and-dairy-adverts-uk/). Many of the ads promoted red meat, which is linked to a variety of [health problems](https://plantbasednews.org/lifestyle/red-meat-type-2-diabetes/). Health bodies, including the UK’s National Health Service (NHS), recommend limiting red meat consumption.
