Current models of early human subsistence economies suggest a focus on large mammal hunting. To evaluate this hypothesis, we examine human bone stable isotope chemistry of <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">24 individuals from the early Holocene</mark> sites of Wilamaya Patjxa (9.0–8.7 cal. ka) and Soro Mik’aya Patjxa (8.0–6.5 cal. ka) located at 3800 meters above sea level <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">on the Andean Altiplano, Peru</mark>. Contrary to expectation, Bayesian mixing models based on the isotope chemistry reveal that <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">plants dominated the diet, comprising 70–95% of the average diet</mark>. Paleoethnobotanical data further show that <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">tubers may have been the most prominent subsistence resource</mark>. These findings update our understanding of earliest forager economies and the pathway to agricultural economies in the Andean highlands. The findings furthermore suggest that the initial subsistence economies of early human populations adapting to new landscapes may have been more plant oriented than current models suggest.
