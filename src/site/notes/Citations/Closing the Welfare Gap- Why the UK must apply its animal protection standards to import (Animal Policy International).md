The RSPCA, Compassion in World Farming and Animal Policy International have released a report that has found that currently many products imported into the UK come from countries where practices banned in the UK are still legal, creating a gap that is expected to grow with new trade deals, undermining public values and disadvantaging British farmers.

This report has found:

*   Of the UKâ€™s 88 trading partners that can currently, or may soon, export animal products to the UK without tariffs, 84 (95%) have lower animal welfare standards than the UK.
*   The UK is effectively outsourcing animal cruelty, with already high numbers of farmed animals suffering overseas for the UK market. This is likely to increase.
*   Existing legislation already mandates that imports of meat must align with UK slaughter laws. Extending these requirements to include production methods would ensure consistency and uphold welfare standards.
