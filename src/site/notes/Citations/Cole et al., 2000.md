Recent industry change in swine-management practices have resulted in a growing controversy surrounding<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> the environmental and public health effects of modern swine production</mark>. The numerous wastes produced by intensive swine production not only pose a significant chalienge to effective environmental management but also are associated with <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">decreased air quality in confinement houses</mark>, potentialy transferable <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">antimicrobial resistance</mark> patterns, and several infectious agents that can be pathogenic to humans. Published studies have documented a variety of contaminants, microbial agents, and health effects in those occupationally exposed to swine, and these
have provided the groundwork for an increasing body of research to evaluate possible community health effects. Nonetheless, several factors limit our ability to define and quantify the potential role of intensive swine-rearing facilities in occupational and community health. Our incomplete understanding and ability to detect specific exposures; the complicated nature of disease etiology, pathogenesis, and surveillance; and the inherent difficulties assodated with study design all contribute to the inadequate level of knowledge that currendy prevails. However, an evaluation of the published literature, and a recognition of the elements that may be compromising these studies, provides the foundation from which future studies may develop.
