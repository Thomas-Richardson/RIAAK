## Summary
<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">ultraprocess animal foods but not PB foods are associated with poor health</mark>
### Background
It is currently unknown whether ultra-processed foods (UPFs) consumption is associated with a higher incidence of multimorbidity. We examined the relationship of total and subgroup consumption of UPFs with the risk of multimorbidity defined as the co-occurrence of at least two chronic diseases in an individual among first cancer at any site, cardiovascular disease, and type 2 diabetes.

### Methods
This was a prospective cohort study including <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">266,666 participants</mark> (60% women) free of cancer, cardiovascular disease, and type 2 diabetes at recruitment from <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">seven European countries</mark> in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study. Foods and drinks consumed over the previous 12 months were assessed at baseline by food-frequency questionnaires and classified according to their degree of processing using <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Nova classification</mark>. We used multistate modelling based on Cox regression to estimate cause-specific hazard ratios (HR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for associations of total and subgroups of UPFs with the risk of multimorbidity of cancer and cardiometabolic diseases.

### Findings
After <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">a median of 11.2 years of follow-up</mark>, 4461 participants (39% women) developed multimorbidity of cancer and cardiometabolic diseases. 
- Higher UPF consumption (per 1 standard deviation increment, ∼260 g/day without alcoholic drinks) was associated with an increased risk of multimorbidity of cancer and cardiometabolic diseases (HR: 1.09, 95% CI: 1.05, 1.12). 
- Among UPF subgroups, <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">associations were most notable for animal-based products</mark> (HR: 1.09, 95% CI: 1.05, 1.12), and artificially and sugar-sweetened beverages (HR: 1.09, 95% CI: 1.06, 1.12). 
- Other subgroups such as ultra-processed breads and cereals (HR: 0.97, 95% CI: 0.94, 1.00) or <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">plant-based alternatives </mark>(HR: 0.97, 95% CI: 0.91, 1.02) <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">were not associated with risk.</mark>
