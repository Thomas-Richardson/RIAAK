# Executive summary — Switzerland “cruel products” import ban

**Proposal.** Add a constitutional and/or statutory basis to prohibit imports of animal products produced by particularly cruel methods. Candidate list: farmed fur, frogs’ legs, foie gras, caged eggs, live-plucked down, exotic leather, shark fins. Legal hooks could include specifying items under Art. 80 (“import of animals and animal products”) or a new article defining “animal dignity” and delegating import rules to the Confederation (Confederation 2021).

**Scale of the problem and welfare harms (selected products).**

- **Frogs’ legs.** ≈5 million frogs consumed annually, with ~88% of Swiss imports sourced from Indonesia where most frogs are wild-caught and slaughter methods are frequently inhumane (Bradley 2014; Frog import origin Switzerland 2001–2006 2021; Kusrini 2005). Where farmed, mortality can approach ~50% across life stages; production relies on insect feed, implying billions of fly larvae raised and killed (FAO 2005; Moreira et al. 2013; Castro et al. 2017; Rowe 2020).  
- **Fur.** 319,882 kg imported/year, implying ≥600,000 animals given typical pelt weights; standard housing and killing methods (CO₂/CO for mink; electrocution for foxes) are associated with significant welfare harms (Swiss Federal Customs Administration 2021a; Rongmei et al. 1998; European Commission 2001; Harris 2015).  
- **Caged eggs.** ~572 million eggs are imported (37% of supply). If the EU share of caged production (~49%) applies, ≈280 million imported eggs are from caged hens (≈1 million hens at ~300 eggs/year) (Infographic: The Swiss egg market 2019; BBC 2021; RSPCA 2020). Cages severely restrict natural behaviours; alternatives (barn/free-range) improve behavioural welfare (Pickett 2007; RSPCA n.d.).  
- **Foie gras.** ~210,000 kg imported/year. Force-feeding begins at 8–10 weeks and raises mortality several-fold versus non–force-fed birds; total affected ducks/geese estimated around 600,000 annually (Four Paws 2020b; CIFOG 2015; Skippon 2013; Compassion in World Farming 2010).  
- **Exotic leather, live-plucked down, shark fins.** Lower volumes but severe concerns: e.g., 2,227 kg shark fins imported in 2020, roughly ~1,100 sharks (Swiss Federal Customs Administration 2021a; Shark Alliance n.d.); investigations report serious welfare abuses in reptile skin supply chains and risks of mislabelled live-plucked down entering markets (PETA 2014; Vanessa Gerritsen 2019; PETA 2016; RSPCA 2019).

**Public support (heterogeneous by product/region).**

- **Fur:** very high opposition; 83% say it’s unjustifiable to kill animals for fur; 90% favour an import ban for items not meeting Swiss standards (Fur Free Alliance 2016).  
- **Foie gras:** majority support for an import ban (60%), with ~30% reporting consumption; notable regional variation (CDE n.d.; “La réalité du foie gras en Suisse” 2019).  
- **Frogs’ legs:** older polling suggests a near-even split on cruelty perceptions; support likely weaker without campaigning that highlights practices (Bradley 2014).  
- **Exotic leather/down:** no direct Swiss polling identified; brand exits and policy moves suggest growing public sensitivity (BBC 2019; The New York Times 2020; Conti 2021; PETA UK 2020).  
- **Cages (contextual):** strong European sentiment against cages; EU has committed to phasing out many cage systems, indicating wider normative support (CIWF 2021; Compassion in World Farming 2020).

**Legal feasibility.**

- WTO **Article XX** exceptions allow measures for **public morals** and **conservation**; the EU seal products ban was upheld as grounded in public morals (WTO 2014a,b; Council of the EU 2015). The US shrimp–turtle ruling supports process-based import conditions where designed non-discriminatorily (WTO 2001).  
- The EU already requires imported meat to meet EU-equivalent **slaughter standards**; expanding to broader welfare has been described by an EU official as WTO-compliant if framed ethically (Broom 2017; Foote 2021).  
- Switzerland’s **cat-fur import ban** (since 2006) offers domestic precedent (SwissInfo 2014).  
- The **Swiss–EU agriculture agreement** emphasises veterinary hygiene/health, not welfare; amendments would likely be needed, especially for foie gras and fur (Federal Council 2020).

**Enforcement and leakage.**

- Verification burdens are real but can be mitigated by focusing on clearly defined categories (e.g., shark fins, frogs’ legs) and using independent equivalence certification; cross-border organic standards illustrate feasibility, typically at <1% of product value (Grethe 2007).  
- **Leakage** via cross-border purchases is a risk: 38% of foie-gras consumers say they would buy abroad, though indistinguishability of substitutes (e.g., faux vs real fur) may temper leakage for some items (“La réalité du foie gras en Suisse” 2019; Kaplan n.d.).

**Substitution effects.**

- Expect shifting to the closest culinary or material substitutes (e.g., pâté or non–force-fed variants for foie gras; barn/free-range for eggs; certified “ethical” down or synthetics; vegan or bovine-leather analogues for exotics). Mislabeling risks mean **enforcement** and **traceability standards** are pivotal (NSF 2018; Lindeke 2019; Lusk 2019; PETA 2016).

**Cost-effectiveness (from the report’s model).**

- The internal CEA indicates most expected impact arises from **frogs’ legs (~73%)**, then **caged eggs (~13%)**, **fur (~10%)**, **foie gras (~3%)**, with others <1% by value—highly sensitive to assumptions about insect moral weight and substitution (report text; Rowe 2020).

**Politics and path-to-win.**

- Parliamentary history is mixed: seal-product import ban passed (2011), while multiple motions on fur/shark fins/exotic leather have failed or stalled; recent motions (2019–2020) face Federal Council resistance (motions 09.428, 10.4104, 11.3635, 13.3331, 15.3832, 19.4425, 19.4583, 20.3021).  
- Campaign viability looks strongest for a package centred on **fur, foie gras, and caged eggs**, with **frogs’ legs** added if polling shows limited drag on overall support (Fur Free Alliance 2016; CDE n.d.; BBC 2021).

**Bottom line.** A targeted import ban is **legally defensible** under public-morals precedents, **popular** for key items (fur, foie gras), and **potentially high-impact** if it includes frogs’ legs and caged eggs. Principal risks are WTO/EU-agreement friction, verification capacity, substitution to other animal products, cross-border leakage, and weaker support for frogs. Priorities: define a narrowly tailored first tranche with strong public backing, design independent equivalence/certification-based enforcement, and pre-negotiate EU-facing adjustments to limit trade frictions (sources above).
