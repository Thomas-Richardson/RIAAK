## Abstract
Existing regulation in the UK states that the term ‘milk’ can only be used in labelling to describe products that originate from animals. We conducted an observational study, which surveyed the availability and labelling of milk substitutes in UK supermarkets, and an online experimental study, which assessed the impact of using the term ‘milk’ on milk substitute labelling. In the experimental study, 352 UK adults were randomised to one of the two conditions where they saw milk substitutes that were either labelled with UK regulations (e.g., soya drink) or using the term ‘milk’ (e.g., soya milk). Our primary aims were to assess whether adding the term ‘milk’ to labels would (1) more accurately communicate the uses of milk substitutes or (2) confuse consumers about which products come from an animal source. In our observational study, milk substitutes were readily available and labelling varied significantly. In our experimental study, labelling products with the term ‘milk’ increased understanding of the product's use. However, participants who saw the term ‘milk’ on milk substitute labelling misidentified more milk substitutes as coming from an animal source. Future policy should consider the clarification of such labelling.
## Notes
In total, 53% of participants in the Milk Labelling Condition correctly identified all 10 milk substitutes, compared to 38% in the No Milk Labelling Condition. In total, 64% of participants in the Milk Labelling did not misidentify any milk substitutes, compared to 89% in the No Milk Labelling Condition. Participants were equally fast at identifying alternatives as alternatives when the term milk was used.

participants in the Milk Labelling Condition correctly identified 0.6 more milk substitutes /10 as a product they would add to a cup of tea or coffee compared to those in the No Milk Labelling Condition. participants in the Milk Labelling Condition misidentified more milk substitutes as being a product that came from an animal source compared to participants in the No Milk Labelling Condition. Again the mean difference of 0.5 did not meet our pre-specified recruitments for a meaningful difference. However, in this case, the 95% CI did not include a meaningful difference, suggesting that any true effect is likely to be below this value.
