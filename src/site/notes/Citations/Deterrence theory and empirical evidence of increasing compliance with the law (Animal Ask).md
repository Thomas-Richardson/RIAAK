# Deterrence theory and empirical evidence of increasing compliance with the law — Exact Summary

## Core idea
- Animal protection laws aim to reduce cruelty by deterring violations via **specific deterrence** (removing high-risk offenders) and **general deterrence** (discouraging potential offenders). The dominant framework is **deterrence theory**, which emphasizes **certainty, severity, and celerity** of sanctions; in practice, perceived (not just objective) costs matter (Becker 1974; Johnson 2019; Paternoster & Simpson 2017).

## Motivations for non-compliance
- **Individual cruelty** is often driven by **emotional/social motives** (anger, “for fun,” fear/dislike, punitive training) rather than profit, implying limited leverage from traditional deterrence tools alone (Kellert & Felthous 1985; Hensley & Tallichet 2005).
- **Work environment** issues correlate with reduced welfare concern; worker abuse and poor conditions can co-occur with animal abuse (Anneberg & Sandøe 2019; Lovell 2016).
- **Neglect** is linked to **farmer distress** (financial crises, divorce, psychiatric problems); inspections can detect issues, but fines may worsen distress. **Support/guidance** and, for chronic/serious cases, **lifetime bans** are appropriate (Andrade & Anneberg 2014; Devitt et al. 2014; Kelly et al. 2011; Anneberg 2020; Stocks 2014; Duff 2010).
- **Economic/management-driven non-compliance** at the farm/company level is under-studied but is the setting where rational-choice deterrence should apply (Paternoster & Simpson 2017).

## What the empirical evidence shows

### Animal-specific enforcement
- **Penalty hikes** are often driven by public sentiment rather than evidence of impact; the goal should be **less cruelty**, not longer sentences (Morton, Hebart & Whittaker 2018; Whitehead 2017; UK Government 2021; DARD 2016).
- **Inspection evidence is thin/mixed**:
  - In France, **~1% of farms are inspected annually**; only **23%** of non-compliant farms improved on re-inspection (Lomellini-Dereclenne et al. 2017).
  - UK broiler farms that perform poorly tend to **remain poor** despite follow-ups (Mullan, Stuijfzand & Butterworth 2021).
  - In the US, **86.5%** of entities warned for AWA violations **continued to violate** (Winders 2018).
- **Certification inspections** correlate with better compliance:
  - **Non-compliance**: **23.1% (uncertified)** vs **11.6% (certified)**; falls further with more schemes (**8.3%** with two; **2.5%** with three). **Unnecessary suffering**: **4.6%** (uncertified) vs **3.1%** (certified). Causality uncertain (Clark et al. 2016).
- **Education alone** shows mixed results (e.g., persistent calf-housing problems in Finland despite national program) (Väärikkälä, Hänninen & Nevas 2019).

### General criminal deterrence (transferable insights)
- **Severity increases** often show **weak or negligible marginal deterrence**, especially for already long sentences (Pratt et al. 2006; Dölling et al. 2009; Nagin 2013; Tonry 2008).
- **Certainty (probability of detection/punishment)** generally has the **strongest deterrent effect**, particularly for non-violent, “calculative” offenses (Sentencing Project 2016; Chalfin & McCrary 2017; Dölling et al. 2009).
- **Meta-findings** (Dölling et al. 2009): across **~700 studies**, **~70%** align fully/partly with deterrence theory; strongest effects in statistics-based studies come from **convictions-to-reported-crime ratios**, **arrests per crime**, and **convicted-to-suspects ratios**; perceived risks and informal sanctions also matter in surveys.

### Corporate deterrence (closest analogue for profit-motivated non-compliance)
- **Systematic review/meta-analysis**: **regulatory policy (inspections)** shows a **deterrent effect** at the **company level**; **combinations** (inspections + sanctions) deter at both **company and individual levels**. Evidence for “law features” or “punitive severity” **alone** is weaker (Schell-Busey et al. 2016). Applicability is strongest where animal-welfare breaches **benefit the firm** (Paternoster & Simpson 2017).

### Environmental enforcement (another analogue)
- Best results come from a **credible deterrence backbone** plus **cooperative elements** calibrated to context; pure cooperation risks inconsistency/agency capture (Rechtschaffen 1997; Paddock, Markell & Bryner 2017).
- **Monitoring, inspections, and enforcement actions** yield **substantial specific and general deterrence** and **emissions reductions**, but the **most effective tool varies by context** (Cohen 2000; Gray & Shimshack 2011).

## Key stats (eye-catching)
- **~1%** of farms inspected per year in France (≈ UK); only **23%** improved on re-inspection (Lomellini-Dereclenne et al. 2017).
- After **warnings**, **86.5%** kept violating the US Animal Welfare Act (Winders 2018).
- **Certification** vs none: **non-compliance 11.6% vs 23.1%**; with multiple schemes: **8.3%** (two) and **2.5%** (three). **Unnecessary suffering 3.1% vs 4.6%** (Clark et al. 2016).
- **Severity boosts**: generally **weak** marginal deterrence; **certainty** of detection/punishment **dominates** (Pratt et al. 2006; Dölling et al. 2009; Nagin 2013; Sentencing Project 2016).
- **~70%** of ~**700** studies show full/partial support for deterrence theory (Dölling et al. 2009).

## Policy implications
- Prioritize raising the **probability of detection**: smarter, risk-based **inspections** and credible follow-through are likely higher-leverage than harsher maximum sentences (Chalfin & McCrary 2017; Dölling et al. 2009; Schell-Busey et al. 2016).
- For **firm-benefiting** non-compliance, use **regulatory inspections** with **educational components** and **meaningful sanctions** in combination (Schell-Busey et al. 2016).
- For **small/neglect-prone** farms, blend **supportive/cooperative** approaches with a credible enforcement threat; address **work conditions** and **farmer distress** (Andrade & Anneberg 2014; Anneberg & Sandøe 2019; Rechtschaffen 1997).
- Treat **sentence-length inflation** with skepticism; focus on **measured reductions in cruelty**, not headline penalties (Morton, Hebart & Whittaker 2018; Nagin 2013; Tonry 2008).

## Evidence gaps
- Little causal evidence on **which surveillance/penalty combinations** minimize animal cruelty; prevalence data itself is limited. Current guidance relies on **analogous literatures** (Hughes & Lawson 2011; Mullan, Stuijfzand & Butterworth 2021; Schell-Busey et al. 2016; Gray & Shimshack 2011).
