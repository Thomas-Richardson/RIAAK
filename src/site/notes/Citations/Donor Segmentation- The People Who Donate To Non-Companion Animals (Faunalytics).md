This Faunalytics analysis compares people who donate to non-companion animal causes (farmed animals, wild animals, etc.) against companion-animal-exclusive donors.

Overall, these analyses revealed several unique characteristics of people who choose to donate to non-companion animals (versus people who donate exclusive to companion animals). Relative to companion-animal-exclusive donors, donors to non-companion animals:

*   Are more likely to work or volunteer with animals.
*   Give more money to animals (but the same proportion of their total donations).
*   Are more likely to have signed a petition or sent an email or letter to support animals, suggesting that they are somewhat more involved in activism.
*   Are less likely to say that a companion animal charity is the most important to them (but 57% still do).
*   Are less likely to prefer donating by mail (but 26% of them still do).
