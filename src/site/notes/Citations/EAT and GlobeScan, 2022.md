- Representative samples of 31 markets around the world (~1000 people each, ~29K respondents!) on their concerns about the current food system and access to healthy and sustainable food

More than one in five consumers (22%) now say that they eat plant-based or vegan food, up from 17 percent in 2019. Eating only plant-based food has increased significantly across many important markets compared to before the pandemic, including the UK and the USA.

• Interest in trying plant-based diets is also significant, especially among younger age groups, with 40 percent of Gen Z, 43 percent of Millennials, 37 percent of Gen X, and 28 percent of Baby Boomers saying they are very interested in trying this way of eating.

• However, there are significant gaps in some countries between those who are interested in switching to a plant-based diet and those who are already doing this. The largest gaps are in Vietnam (38 percentage points), Thailand (36 percentage points), and Brazil (22 percentage points). At the global level, younger generations also have a larger aspiration-action gap.

• Looking toward the future, more than four in ten people (42%) say that in the next ten years most people will definitely or probably be eating plant-based food instead of meat. Younger people are more likely to think this shift will happen, as are those living in Africa and Asia. North Americans and Europeans are
the least optimistic about a large-scale shift toward vegetarian eating.
