- The report argues that the highest value objective is **improving the conditions of the species of fish farmed in the largest numbers of individuals and life-years in the EU: sea bass, sea bream, and (small) rainbow trout.**
- The report argues that **humane slaughter looks like the most promising EU policy ask this year**, and provides concrete recommendations of what needs to be done to secure the most impactful version of this policy.
- **There is a lot of economic and political precedent the aquatic animal advocacy movement needs to start creating years in advance to make the most of EFSA opinions on farmed fish welfare** â€“ the report discusses what sort of evidence the movement might need in the report.
- The report discusses how the movement can reallocate resources and change tactics depending on how the larger EU animal legislation reform is developing, namely by **shifting attention to gathering evidence on rearing reforms.**
