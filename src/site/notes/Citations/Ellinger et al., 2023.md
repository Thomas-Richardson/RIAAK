Ellinger, S., Amini, A. M., Haardt, J., Lehmann, A., Schmidt, A., Bischoff-Ferrari, H. A., ... & German Nutrition Society. (2023). Protein intake and body weight, fat mass and waist circumference: an umbrella review of systematic reviews for the evidence-based guideline on protein intake of the German Nutrition Society. _European Journal of Nutrition_, 1-30.

## TLDR
> [!summary]
> Incredibly strong review of systematic reviews, mostly of RCTs that establishes that high protein diets don't affect weight, fat mass or waist circumference. The evidence is not good enough to tell whether protein type matters (plant vs animal protein).

## Purpose
This umbrella review aimed to assess whether dietary protein intake with regard to quantitative (higher vs. lower dietary protein intake) and qualitative considerations (total, plant-based or animal-based protein intake) affects body weight (BW), fat mass (FM) and waist circumference (WC).

## Methods
A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for systematic reviews (SRs) with and without meta-analyses of prospective studies published between 04 October 2007 and 04 January 2022. Methodological quality and outcome-specific certainty of evidence of the retrieved SRs were assessed by using AMSTAR 2 and NutriGrade, respectively, in order to rate the overall certainty of evidence using predefined criteria.

## Results
Thirty-three SRs were included in this umbrella review; 29 were based on randomised controlled trials, a few included cohort studies. In studies without energy restriction, a high-protein diet did not modulate BW, FM and WC in adults in general (all “possible” evidence); for older adults, overall certainty of evidence was “insufficient” for all parameters. Under hypoenergetic diets, a high-protein diet mostly decreased BW and FM, but evidence was “insufficient” due to low methodological quality. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Evidence regarding an influence of the protein type on BW, FM and WC was “insufficient”</mark>.

## Conclusion
“Possible” evidence exists that the amount of protein does not affect BW, FM and WC in adults under isoenergetic conditions. Its impact on the reduction in BW and FM under hypoenergetic conditions remains unclear; evidence for an influence of protein type on BW, FM and WC is “insufficient”.
