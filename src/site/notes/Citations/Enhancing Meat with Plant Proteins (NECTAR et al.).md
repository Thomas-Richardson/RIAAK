### **Executive Summary**
**Recommendations and Insights for BPs in APAC**

#### **Concept Perception**
*BPs can appeal to a wider set of consumers, even those currently uninterested in fully plant-based meat*

**BPs offer a new way to appeal to an untapped set of consumers**
*   50% of those who 'would buy' or 'definitely would buy' a BP showed low intent to purchase plant-based meat, indicating the potential to unlock new consumer profiles
*   22% of consumers 'would buy' or 'definitely would buy' BPs, reaching 1.4x more consumers than plant-based products (only 16% stated they 'would buy' or 'definitely would buy')
*   With the introduction of BPs, 32% of consumers said they would buy products to reduce their meat consumption - higher than the 19% who would do so when plant-based meat was the only alternative

**BPs need consumer-led innovation and communication to rival conventional meat**
*   Nearly 4x more participants 'would buy' or 'definitely would buy' animal meat (85%) compared to BPs (22%)

#### **Taste Performance**
*BPs can outperform 100% animal meat on taste, yet most products require further R&D to capture meaningful market share*

**At least one BP product has achieved taste superiority over the animal benchmark, a particularly impressive result given the category's nascency**
*   An BP chicken mince was preferred to a 100% chicken mince on liking (p<0.05)

**Several BP products are approaching taste parity with animal meat**
*   The leading BP chicken chunk and beef mince were within 0.2 points ("pts") of the animal on a 7pt liking scale; meatballs, chicken tenders, and chicken patties were within 0.5pts

**BPs offer an immediate opportunity to deliver the benefits of plants while fully plant-based products continue development**
*   BPs were 1.8x more likely to be rated as 'like very much' or 'like' than plant-based meat (37% vs 21%)

**But more R&D is needed to drive category-wide growth for BPs**
*   60% of participants rated the animal as 'like very much' or 'like' compared to just 37% for BPs

---

#### **R&D Opportunities**
*BPs should focus on closing gaps in liking, particularly flavour, before investing heavily in product launches*

**Flavour sets leading BPs apart and accounts for the biggest gap in liking between average BPs and animal meat**
*   35% rated BPs as 'like very much' or 'like' on flavour, trailing leading BPs (50%) and animal products (65%)
*   BPs must improve their aftertaste, meatiness, savouriness, and saltiness while reducing off-flavours, beany / pea / soy notes, and blandness

**Appearance should be a key secondary focus for BPs, texture is tertiary**
*   Just 42% rated the appearance of leading BPs as 'like very much' or 'like' (versus 62% for the animal)
*   Although still present, gaps on texture were smaller compared to flavour or appearance

**Explore BPs with at least 50% meat in ground formats using savoury vegetables as a plant-based component**
*   Participants indicated that these concepts were conceptually most appealing to them

---

#### **GTM Strategy**
*BPs should highlight health as a differentiator, position with familiarity rather than novelty, and surprise on taste and price*

**Health offers an angle for BPs to differentiate on a key purchasing driver**
*   69% rated BPs as healthier than conventional meat while 15% rated them the same, driving a relative increase in purchase intent of 0.5pts (similar to the impact of being perceived as better priced or tastier)

**But BPs still have gaps to close with animal products on perceptions of taste, price, and familiarity**
*   69-87% favoured animal products on taste, price, or familiarity, compared to BPs at just 3-16% preference
