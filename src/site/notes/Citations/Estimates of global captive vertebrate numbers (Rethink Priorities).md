In this article, I list all the estimates I could find for numbers of vertebrates that are farmed or kept in captivity for various purposes. I also describe some groups of captive vertebrates for which I found no estimates. For some bigger groups of animals that are less well-known amongst animal activists, I also describe trends and main welfare concerns.

The purpose of the article is to make it easier to find and compare estimates. Hopefully, this can also help animal advocates decide which issues to focus on. Note that I chose to focus on captive vertebrates simply to limit the scope of the article.

### Summary tables
Estimates are summarized in the tables below. Numbers can also be explored in [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19PddOotzaZwMpEHBfl_tdo3n4dzieLPP9koD2ml-uH0/edit?usp=sharing). The rest of the article provides sources and explanations for these numbers.

All figures are for the whole world unless otherwise specified. For brevity, I use *M* for a *million* (10^6) and *B* for a *billion* (10^9).

If estimates in tables above seem difficult to compare and comprehend, it may be useful to look at [the appendix](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/pT7AYJdaRp6ZdYfny/estimates-of-global-captive-vertebrate-numbers#Appendix_1__Comprehending_the_numbers__seconds_of_silence_) where I convert estimates into units of time. Estimates can also be explored in [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19PddOotzaZwMpEHBfl_tdo3n4dzieLPP9koD2ml-uH0/edit?usp=sharing).
