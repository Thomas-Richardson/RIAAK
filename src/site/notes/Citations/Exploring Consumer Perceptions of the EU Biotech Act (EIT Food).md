The EIT Food Consumer Observatory’s ‘Uncovering Consumer Perceptions of the Upcoming Biotech Act’ report is designed to help EU policymakers and national government representatives understand how to shape, implement and communicate the upcoming Biotech Act in a way that optimises public support.

The report reveals the factors likely to drive consumer acceptance of the Biotech Act, allowing policymakers to draft an act that aligns with consumer priorities and values. It also provides the food industry with insights on consumer acceptance of biotechnology, which can help inform the development and marketing of new products.

Biotechnology offers a potential solution to some of the biggest threats facing our food system - helping to improve food security, health and nutrition, and increase competitiveness and resilience of the agri-food sector. 

The EU Biotech Act, currently scheduled for 2026, aims to provide the regulatory framework to strengthen this new frontier in food production, while ensuring high safety standards. 

Ahead of its launch, this report uses both qualitative and quantitative insights to understand European citizens’ perceptions of food produced through advanced biotechnology, and 
their expectations and reservations regarding the Act introduced to oversee it. It measures consumers’ acceptance of the Act, what they believe the impact will be, their trust in the EU to administer the regulation, and overall perceptions of the fairness of the policy.

The report is a must-read for policymakers and national governments who are involved in the shaping of the Biotech Act and its implementation, as well as for those in the industry who want to ensure their products meet the expectations of target consumers.
