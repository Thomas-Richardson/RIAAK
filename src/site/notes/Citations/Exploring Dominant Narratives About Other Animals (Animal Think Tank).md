4.  Hierarchy
5.  Economy
6.  Welfare
7.  Animal sentience

### Key insights and recommendations for animal freedom communicators

**Participants believed that some types of animal use were necessary:**

*   Use persuasive narratives (like animal abilities, to inspire empathy and awe; kinship, to inspire unity and connection; and morality, to inspire altruism and compassion) to encourage people to see that all animal use is unnecessary because it is morally wrong, no matter how it might 'benefit' humans.
*   Disrupt harmful narratives that influence people's views of what animal uses are 'necessary' through showcasing alternatives that enable a better future that is free of animal exploitation (and also speaks to the persuasive social progress narrative).
*   Highlight how animal use harms all of us - fellow animals, humans and our shared planet - further disrupting the narrative of necessity.

**Participants showed a natural concern for the wellbeing of animals:**

*   Speak to people's (and society's) aspirational identities. Our messages and stories need to remind people that they already do care about other animals, and that we all want to live in a society that cares about other animals too.
*   Use values-based narratives (like care and connection) to promote a vision of the future where animals have a life worth living, and we can thrive together.
*   Highlight how are shared values are being violated by animal industries that do not prioritise their wellbeing, and how they deceive us through marketing lies that capitalise on our natural empathy for other animals.

**Participants categorised different species/uses of animals:**

*   Dismantle anthropocentric and hierarchal narratives by using the animal abilities narrative. Celebrate all animals as individuals, with similar traits and value to animal companions and humans, who are currently seen as the 'top' of the 'hierarchy'. Particular attention needs to be paid to animals seen at the 'bottom' of the hierarchy, such as fishes, rats, mice and insects, sharing stories that make them more relatable.
*   Unique differences should be celebrated as awe-inspiring, and speak to the beauty of diversity, helping to break down the barriers of constructed categories (like 'pets', 'pests', 'food', 'domesticated', 'wild', 'cute' and 'dangerous').

**Participants believed animals were living, feeling beings:**

*   Use the already dominant animal sentience narrative to promote a shift from some animals being seen as 'something' to all animals being seen as 'someone'. Using the animal abilities narrative will also help propel this shift.
