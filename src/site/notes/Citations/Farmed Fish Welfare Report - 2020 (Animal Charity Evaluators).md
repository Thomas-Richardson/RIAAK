Farmed fish welfare is plausibly one of the effective animal advocacy communityâ€™s priorities because of the current neglectedness of the issue, the likelihood that farmed fish suffering is large in scale, and the potential tractability of interventions to improve farmed fish welfare. With this in mind, ACE would like to reduce uncertainty about the impact of corporate campaigns aimed at improving farmed fish welfare. We hope that the following analysis will help us move toward that goal.

This report covers considerations relevant to determining appropriate indicators of farmed fish welfare. It also discusses potential reforms to improve the welfare of farmed fishes. Following that, it outlines key resources and questions for further consideration. The appendix provides some further information about farmed fish production, our literature search, and our approach to analyzing the literature.
