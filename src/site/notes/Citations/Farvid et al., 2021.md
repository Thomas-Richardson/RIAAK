Farvid, M. S., Sidahmed, E., Spence, N. D., Mante Angua, K., Rosner, B. A., & Barnett, J. B. (2021). Consumption of red meat and processed meat and cancer incidence: a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective studies. _European journal of epidemiology_, _36_, 937-951.


> [!NOTE] TLDR
> This review finds that people who eat high levels of red and/or processed meat have higher levels of up to 7 different types of cancer


Red meat and processed meat consumption has been hypothesized to increase risk of cancer, but the evidence is inconsistent. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective studies to summarize the evidence of associations between consumption of red meat (unprocessed), processed meat, and total red and processed meat with the incidence of various cancer types. We searched in MEDLINE and EMBASE databases <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">through December 2020</mark>. Using a random-effect meta-analysis, we calculated the pooled relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of the highest versus the lowest category of red meat, processed meat, and total red and processed meat consumption in relation to incidence of various cancers. We identified <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">148 published articles</mark>. 

Red meat consumption was significantly associated with greater risk of: 
- breast cancer (RR = 1.09; 95% CI = 1.03–1.15)
- endometrial cancer (RR = 1.25; 95% CI = 1.01-1.56)
- colorectal cancer (RR = 1.10; 95% CI = 1.03–1.17)
- colon cancer (RR = 1.17; 95% CI = 1.09-1.25)
- rectal cancer (RR = 1.22; 95% CI = 1.01-1.46)
- lung cancer (RR = 1.26; 95% CI = 1.09–1.44)
- hepatocellular carcinoma (RR = 1.22; 95% CI = 1.01-1.46). 

Processed meat consumption was significantly associated with: 
- a 6% greater breast cancer risk, 
- an 18% greater colorectal cancer risk, 
- a 21% greater colon cancer risk, 
- a 22% greater rectal cancer risk, and 
- a 12% greater lung cancer risk. 

Total red and processed meat consumption was significantly associated with:
- greater risk of colorectal cancer (RR = 1.17; 95% CI = 1.08–1.26)
- colon cancer (RR = 1.21; 95% CI = 1.09–1.34)
- rectal cancer (RR = 1.26; 95% CI = 1.09–1.45)
- lung cancer (RR = 1.20; 95% CI = 1.09-1.33)
- and renal cell cancer (RR = 1.19; 95% CI = 1.04–1.37).
