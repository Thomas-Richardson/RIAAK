Here’s a structured summary of **“Feeding Britain from the Ground Up”** (Sustainable Food Trust, June 2022)

---

## Purpose & scope

- The report asks: what would a UK-wide transition to **sustainable, ecologically based farming** look like, in terms of land use, food production, diets, trade and food security?
    
- It models an approach based on _agroecological / land-sharing_ principles rather than intensified “land sparing” methods.
    
- The authors aim to be transparent about assumptions, trade-offs and uncertainties.

## Key concepts & principles

- They do **not** tie themselves to any single label (organic, regenerative, biodynamic), but instead define guiding principles:  
    – The farm as an ecosystem  
    – Circular economy (reduce, recycle, nutrient cycling)  
    – Health & wellbeing (soil, plants, animals, humans, environment)
    
- Key characteristics of the modeled sustainable systems include:  
    • Minimising use of non-renewable external inputs, synthetic fertilisers, pesticides  
    • Using crop rotations with fertility-building phases (legumes, pasture)  
    • Integrating livestock grazing (on land unsuitable for crops) with ecological management  
    • Reducing and recycling waste both on-farm and in supply chains  
    • Promoting diversity (crops, genetics, enterprises, landscape)  
    • Producing nutrient-dense, high quality food rather than just maximizing yield  
    • Delivering social, cultural, and community benefits (jobs, engagement, wellbeing)

## Methodology in brief

- The authors use a **4-step modelling approach** (detailed in Chapter 3) to simulate a transition across all UK agricultural land under these sustainable principles.
    
- They estimate how land use would shift, how much food would be produced under those systems, and what dietary patterns would align with those production levels.
    
- They explore implications for **self-sufficiency**, trade (imports/exports), and nutritional adequacy under more sustainable diets.
    
- They are explicit about modelling limitations, uncertainties, and trade-offs.

## Main findings

### Land use and farming systems

- A widespread shift toward **mixed farming** is projected: arable areas would re-incorporate grazing, and some grassland would move toward cropping in historically non-cropped regions.
    
- Woodland cover is assumed to increase by close to **1 million hectares**, plus more agroforestry and land allocated for nature/conservation.
    
- Across farms, integration of trees, habitat-rich margins and ecological features would expand.
    

### Food production & output changes

- **Vegetables and fruits**: output would roughly **double**, with greater crop diversity and more distributed production.
    
- **Pulses** (beans, peas): production also projected to double, both for rotation benefits and dietary use.
    
- **Grains / cereals**: production would **fall by about 50%**, largely due to reduced synthetic inputs and a lower area under intensive cereal crops.
    
- **Chicken, pork, eggs**: steep declines — chicken & pork down ~75 %, eggs ~50 %, as systems shift to higher welfare, lower input, free-range models.
    
- **Beef & lamb**: remain roughly stable, as grazing systems continue to play a role.
    
- **Milk / dairy**: projected to fall by ~25 %, due to transition to pasture-based systems with lower yields.
    

### Diets, self-sufficiency, and food security

- Under diets aligned to what such a sustainable UK agriculture could supply (less meat, more vegetables/pulses, less waste), **self-sufficiency could be maintained or even improved** relative to current levels.
    
- The model suggests that with dietary shifts and waste reduction, the UK would not need to increase imports relative to today.
    
- Diets would feature increased seasonal vegetables, pulses, more diverse cereals (e.g. oats, rye), more modest consumption of chicken, pork and dairy (but of higher welfare/quality).

## Implications, trade-offs & challenges

- Transitioning at scale requires **major shifts in policy, economics, infrastructure, finance, education and consumer behaviour**.
    
- Subsidy systems would have to be redirected, applying “polluter pays” principles, and regulatory interventions would become more important.
    
- Financial institutions, investment, banks and the private sector need to be aligned to support sustainable farming.
    
- Decentralised processing, distribution and supply chains will need investment to handle more diverse, localised outputs.
    
- Consumer education, food & farming literacy, public campaigns will be needed to support dietary change and reduction in food waste.
    
- Food prices are expected to **rise** under the new systems. To protect food access for low-income groups, government intervention will be essential.
    
- Monitoring, metrics and transparency will matter: the report calls for the development of internationally harmonised frameworks to measure agricultural sustainability and link them to food labelling.

## Conclusions & recommendations (in brief)

- The authors conclude that a transition to agricultural methods more aligned with ecological limits is feasible in the UK, _if_ accompanied by dietary change and waste reduction.
    
- They argue that with proper enabling policies and investment, a sustainable farming system could maintain or even improve food security and self-sufficiency while delivering environmental and social benefits.
    
- Key recommendations include: redirecting subsidy and regulatory frameworks, mobilising finance, restructuring infrastructure, enhancing monitoring systems, and fostering public engagement/education.
    
- The report is explicit that uncertainties, trade-offs and value judgments are inherent: other modelling choices might lead to different outcomes.
