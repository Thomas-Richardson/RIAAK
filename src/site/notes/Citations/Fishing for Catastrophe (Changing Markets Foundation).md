This report does not contain an executive summary. Here is a summary of its key points.

This report, "Fishing for Catastrophe," by the Changing Markets Foundation, investigates the risks associated with the production of fishmeal and fish oil (FMFO) from wild-caught fish to feed farmed seafood.

*   **Core Problem:** The report argues that the aquaculture industry's reliance on FMFO is environmentally and socially destructive, posing significant financial, reputational, and supply chain risks to companies and their investors.
*   **Scale of Dependence:** In 2016, 69% of the world's fishmeal and 75% of its fish oil production was used for aquaculture, directly linking the health of farmed seafood supply chains to the exploitation of wild marine resources.
*   **Destructive Sourcing Practices:** On-the-ground investigations in India, Vietnam, and The Gambia uncovered highly unsustainable and often illegal practices, including:
    *   Widespread illegal, unregulated, and unreported (IUU) fishing.
    *   Indiscriminate catching of juvenile fish and non-target species ("waste" fish).
    *   Severe pollution from FMFO processing plants.
    *   Threats to local food security by diverting edible fish from human consumption to animal feed.
*   **Supply Chain Links:** The investigation traced this unsustainably produced FMFO through the supply chain to major European aquafeed producers (like Skretting, EWOS/Cargill, and BioMar) and subsequently to seafood processors and major retailers.
*   **Retailer Exposure:** Numerous European retailers were found to be sourcing seafood from supply chains linked to these destructive practices, including Sainsbury's, ALDI, Lidl, Tesco, and Marks & Spencer (UK); Auchan and Groupe Casino (France); and ALDI SÜD, REWE, and EDEKA (Germany).
*   **Failure of Certification:** The report heavily criticizes the IFFO Responsible Supply (IFFO RS) certification scheme, calling it a "sustainability smokescreen." It highlights a conflict of interest, as IFFO is primarily a trade association for the FMFO industry, and found that certified companies were linked to the destructive practices it uncovered.
*   **Resource & Financial Risk:** The report warns that FMFO demand will soon outstrip the finite supply of wild fish. The FAO and OECD predict prices will increase by 58% for fishmeal and 83% for fish oil by 2028 (compared to 2005 levels), threatening the profitability of the aquaculture industry.
*   **Reputational & Compliance Risk:** Companies are exposed to significant reputational damage from association with destructive fishing and food insecurity in the Global South. The prevalence of IUU fishing also creates major compliance and geopolitical risks.
*   **Recommendations for Investors:** The report urges investors to engage with companies to:
    *   **Aquafeed Industry:** Reduce and ultimately eliminate reliance on FMFO from whole wild-caught fish and develop sustainable, scalable alternative feed ingredients.
    *   **Aquaculture Industry:** Prioritize farming species that require little to no fish in their feed (e.g., shellfish, tilapia, carp).
    *   **Retailers:** Provide full supply chain transparency and eliminate products that use FMFO from wild-caught fish.
