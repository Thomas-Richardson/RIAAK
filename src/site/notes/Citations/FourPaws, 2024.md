Austria, Germany, Switzerland, UK, Spain, France, Italy, Bulgaria, Netherlands, Australia, US and South Africa.

A nationally representative sample of 10,891 adults

- Globally (i.e. across all 12 markets), nearly two-thirds (65%) of adults are aware of animal cruelty issues in the fashion industry.
- Women are more likely to be aware than men (68% compared to 61%).
- Swiss adults (83%) and Austrian adults (80%) are most aware of any animal cruelty issues in the fashion industry, while Australians (48%), US adults (49%), and Spanish adults (49%) are the least aware.
- Gen Z and Millennials are more likely than older generations to be aware of animal cruelty issues (72% and 71% respectively compared to Gen X 62%, Baby Boomers 58%, and Silent 46%.
- The category global adults (i.e. across all markets) are most concerned about with regards to the welfare and treatment of animals involved is fur (from mink, fox, raccoon dog, etc.), with eight in ten (81%) very or fairly concerned. 
	- Swiss adults and Italians are most concerned about this (CH 90%, IT 90%), followed closely by Austrians (89%). 
	- Conversely, those in the US and AU are the least concerned (68% and 67% respectively).
- This is followed by exotic [[Leather is a co-product not a by product and is bad for the environment\|leather]] (from crocodiles, snakes, etc.), with three-quarters (75%) very or fairly concerned. 
	- Swiss adults, Austrians and Germans are most concerned about this with over eight in ten concerned (CH 85%, AT 84%, DE 84%)
	- Those in the US and AU being the least concerned (58% respectively).
- Seven in ten (69%) global adults are concerned about animal welfare and treatment in exotic feather (from peafowl, ostriches, etc.) 
	- South African adults are the most concerned (80%), while Bulgarians are the least concerned (55%).
- Three-fifths (59%) of global adults are concerned about animal welfare and treatment in feather/ down (from geese, ducks, etc.)
	- South Africans and Italians are the most concerned (73% and 72% respectively), while Bulgarians are the least concerned (43%).
- Nearly six in ten global adults (57%) are concerned about animal welfare and treatment in domestic animal [[Leather is a co-product not a by product and is bad for the environment\|leather]] (from bovine/cow, sheep, goat, etc.) - again, South Africans and Italians are the most concerned (74% and 73% respectively), while Swiss adults are the least concerned (44%).
- Half (50%) of global adults are concerned about animal welfare and treatment in cashmere (from cashmere goats) - South African adults are the most concerned (72%), while UK adults and Bulgarians are the least concerned (UK 41%, BG 40%).
- Just a third adults globally (33%) are concerned about animal welfare and treatment in [[Wool\|wool]] (from sheep). Nearly three in five (58%) South Africans are concerned, the highest out of all markets, while only 23% of Swiss and Dutch adults are concerned, the lowest of all markets.

## Familiar with 'mulesing’
- Only one in six (18%) global adults say they are familiar with a common farming procedure known as 'mulesing' (otherwise known as 'live lamb cutting'), which is practiced on most wool-producing merino sheep in Australia, including 8% who know its meaning and 9% who are not 100% sure what it means.
- South Africans (43%) and Australians (41%) are most likely to say they are familiar ‘mulesing’ compared to adults from other countries, while UK adults, Dutch adults and Germans are least likely to say they are familiar with ‘mulesing’ (9% respectively). 
- Gen Z and Millennials are more likely than older generations to be familiar with ‘mulesing’ (21% respectively compared to Gen X 16%, Baby Boomers 14%, and Silent 15%).
### Retailers should phase out use of mulesed wool
- After learning about the practice of 'mulesing' in Australia and the availability of pain-free alternatives, four in five (80%) adults globally agree that retailers sourcing wool should phase out their use of wool from mulesed sheep, with over three-fifths (62%) strongly agreeing.
- Swiss adults and Italians are most likely to agree with this (88% respectively), while Bulgarians are the least likely to agree (57%). 
- Women are more likely to strongly agree than men (68% compared to 56%).
- Interestingly, Gen Z are least likely to agree with this (75%) compared to their older counterparts.

## Attitudes towards animal welfare
- Globally, over seven in ten (72%) say fashion brands should be responsible for assuring animal welfare standards are upheld throughout their supply chains. Four in five (79%) UK adults agree with this attitude, the highest across all markets, followed
closely by Spanish and French adults (78% respectively).
• Over half (53%) of global adults say fashion brands should be transparent about their standards when it comes to animal welfare.
Again, most likely among UK adults (63%).
• Half (50%) of global adults say companies should give animal protection equal priority to environmental protection and social
standards (working conditions) within their Corporate Social Responsibility strategies and policies. South Africans are the most
likely to say this (63%).
• Over two-fifths (44%) of adults globally say brands need to better care for the animals in their supply chain – with Swiss adults
most likely to say so (56%), followed by UK adults (53%).
• While over a third (36%) say they will choose one fashion brand over another if they prioritise animal welfare - again, most likely
among Swiss adults (48%), followed by French adults (45%).
• Only one in ten (9%) say fashion brand or animal welfare certification claims can be trusted at face value – with South Africans
most likely to say this (14%), followed closely by Australians (13%) and Dutch adults (12%).

View on fur farming and trade in the country
• Globally, nearly three in five (57%) adults believe that both the farming, import and the sale of fur should be banned in their country,
while one in ten believe that fur farming, import and sales should continue (10%). A similar proportion say the country should ban
the import and sale of fur but allow farming of fur locally (10%), while only 4% say the country should ban farming of fur locally but
allow the import and sale of fur. One in five (19%) are unsure about their view on this.
• Italians are the most likely to say both the farming, import and the sale of fur should be banned in their country (78%), while US
adults are the least likely to say so (33%).
• Women are more likely than men to believe that both the farming, import and the sale of fur should be banned in their country (64%
compared to 49%).
• Baby Boomers are the most likely generation to say both the farming, import and the sale of fur should be banned in their country
(67%)

Fashion purchasing habits
• Two-thirds (68%) of global adults are conscious about animal welfare, including over a-fifth who say they currently seek out or
purchase fashion items with animal welfare credentials (22%), a similar proportion (19%) who say they would buy more animal-free
fashion if they had more access to sustainable alternatives, and over a quarter (27%) who say they have decided to avoid animal-
based fashion products all together.
• Italians and South Africans are the most likely to be conscious about animal welfare (79% respectively), while US residents are the
least likely (56%) to be conscious about animal welfare.
• One in six (16%) global adults say they currently seek out higher quality/ more durable fashion items that also have higher animal
welfare credentials, with Dutch adults being the most likely (30%), and US adults being the least likely (11%).
• 6% of adults globally currently only purchase products made from animal derived materials that have been certified by an animal
welfare standard, with South Africans being the most likely (11%), and Germans being the least likely (3%).
• South Africans are the most likely to say they would buy more animal-free fashion if they had more access to sustainable
alternatives (28%), while Germans are the least likely to say so (12%).
• Furthermore, Italians are the most likely to say they have decided to avoid animal-based fashion products all together (37%), while
Dutch adults are the least likely to say so (14%).
• One in ten (9%) adults globally currently choose cheap or fast fashion items including those made from animal products, with
Australians being the most likely (15%), and French adults (5%) being the least likely.
• A similar proportion (8%) say they currently seek out higher quality/ more durable fashion items, regardless of their animal welfare
credentials, with French adults being the most likely to say so (15%) and UK adults, Bulgarians and Italians are the least likely to
say so (6% respectively).

Fashion companies should reduce the use of animal derived materials and invest in alternatives and
transition to sustainable animal-friendly material alternatives
• Eight in ten (81%) adults globally agree that fashion companies should reduce the use of animal derived materials and invest in
alternatives and transition to sustainable animal-friendly material alternatives (such as recycled or plant-based materials), including
half (51%) who strongly agree with this.
• Italians are the most likely to strongly agree with this (66%), while Australians and US adults are the least likely to strongly agree
with this (38% respectively).
• Women are more likely than men to strongly agree with this (57% compared to 44%).
