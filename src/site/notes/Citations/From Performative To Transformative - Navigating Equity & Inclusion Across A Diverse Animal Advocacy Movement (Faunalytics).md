This report explores how farmed animal advocacy organizations can meaningfully integrate diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) principles into their missions and practices in ways that enhance strategic focus and intended impact. Grounded in qualitative interviews with BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, and People of Color) advocates and movement leaders, as well as desk research on over 200 organizations, the report examines persistent cultural and structural barriers to inclusion and offers pathways for transformation. It is intended for a wide range of farmed animal advocacy movement stakeholders- organizational leaders, movement members, funders, and especially BIPOC advocates navigating their roles within a predominantly white-led movement.

The report begins by framing DEI efforts through two distinct but related approaches-

1.  **Organizational justice**, which emphasizes procedural and structural fairness; and
2.  **Social justice**, which centers identity, power, and systemic transformation.

The overarching thesis is that engagement with organizational justice is the bare minimum for DEI in this movement. How much social justice is incorporated should depend on a clear understanding of the organization’s identity and answers to key questions- *“Who are we?”*, *“What do we do?”*, and *“How do we do it?”* DEI work must be pursued intentionally and in alignment with this identity.

The report then offers two tailored sets of recommendations for organizations and their leaders-

*   **Table 1** outlines **minimum DEI expectations** by advocacy approach (Direct Animal Care, Individual Advocacy, and Institutional Advocacy), recognizing that organizational size and structure influence both capacity and responsibility.
*   **Table 2** provides **aspirational recommendations** by mission scope (Farmed Animal Welfare/Rights, Health and/or Environment, and Social Justice), encouraging deeper community engagement and cross-movement solidarity for organizations ready to lead beyond baseline inclusion and equity work.

Ultimately, the report calls on all actors to move beyond symbolic DEI gestures toward strategies rooted in accountability, power-sharing, and value alignment. It is offered both as a resource and an invitation to help shape a more inclusive and justice-driven movement.
