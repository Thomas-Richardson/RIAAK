public opinion survey regarding Filipino consumers' attitudes on plant-based foods

206 people

Plant-based foods such as vegetables, grains, beans, tofu, plant-based meat alternatives, and soy products are
widely recognized by Filipino consumers as healthier and more sustainable options compared to conventional
animal products. The survey reveals strong awareness of the benefits of plant-based nutrition, with 90.8% of
respondents acknowledging that plant-based foods are healthier and more sustainable than conventional animal
proteins.

The survey found overwhelming support for increasing plant-based food consumption, with 83% of consumers
expressing their intention to increase the amount of plant-based foods they eat in the coming year. This demon-
strates a clear shift in dietary preferences among Filipino consumers.
Furthermore, 92.7% of respondents believe that food companies such as hotels, restaurants, and retailers have a
responsibility to manage the sustainability and health of their food supply chain. An even higher percentage (85%)
agree that these businesses should serve and sell more plant-based foods to promote sustainability and public
health.

The survey reveals strong consumer support for businesses that prioritize plant-based options. 80.1% of consumers
indicated they would be more likely to patronize restaurants, hotels, and retailers that set policy goals to increase
the amount of plant-based foods they serve. This represents a significant business opportunity for food service
establishments looking to align with consumer values and preferences.
These findings suggest that the Filipino market is ready for expanded plant-based food offerings, with consumers
demonstrating both awareness of the benefits and willingness to support businesses that prioritize sustainable,
health-conscious food options.
