#citation  #economics #meat 

- [[UK Meat prices have risen faster than prices of pb alts in recent years\|UK Meat prices have risen faster than prices of pb alts in recent years]]

basically, <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Though we only have a limited data on other products, it does not seem that in the last 40 years meat shows more price volatility than non meat foods in the US</mark>

The high food prices experienced over recent years have led to the widespread view that food price volatility has increased. However, volatility has generally been lower over the two most recent decades than previously. Variability over the most recent period has been high but, with the important exception of rice, not out of line with historical experience. There is weak evidence that grains price volatility more generally may be increasing but it is too early to say.
