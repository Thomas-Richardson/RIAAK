6 segments made according to awareness and experience of PB meats:

- High awareness of PB options but under half had tried
- Most of the people who are interested in pb alts are also high meat eaters not looking to switch
- half of todays consumers are millennials
- surprisingly more (I think 38%) said PB alts were tasty compared to less than 10% I think that said they didn't like it
- affordability, health, taste and variety
- Very open to blended products

Health tended to be the most important factor

- 20-25% of people wanted to reduce meat, 25% wanted to increase
- Many are wanting to eat more fish (44%) almost none wanting to reduce fish
