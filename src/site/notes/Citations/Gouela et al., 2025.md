Meat alternatives are designed to be used as like-for-like replacements for meat; however, meat is a source of key nutrients. Implications for the impact on dietary intakes are unknown. Nutritional information on plant-based meat alternatives (<i>n</i> = 475) and meat products (<i>n</i> = 754) available in the UK was collected. The products were categorized into food type as per the UK National Diet and Nutrition Survey (NDNS) and into sub-categories: meat (ME), plant-based (PB) and mycoprotein (MP). The NDNS data were used to calculate the intake of meat products across age groups. PB and MP were then substituted for meat intakes, and energy and nutrient intakes were calculated and compared to UK Dietary Reference Values. Price, fat, saturated fat, carbohydrate, sugar, protein, fibre, and energy were different between ME, MP and PB products (<i>P</i> < 0.001), leading to changes in nutrient intakes. There was considerable variation between product categories, highlighting the impact of like-for-like replacements on nutrient intakes.
