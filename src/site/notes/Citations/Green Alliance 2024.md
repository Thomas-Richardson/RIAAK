"A new land dividend for Europe"

https://green-alliance.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/A_new_land_dividend.pdf

Our analysis suggests that, even with very limited support, they could displace a sixth of European meat and dairy consumption by 2050

Reducing demand for meat and dairy by two thirds would mean 44 per cent of the farmland in the ten European countries we studied would no longer be needed for growing feed and grazing animals. Overseas land use would fall even further, by 57 per cent, releasing an area equivalent to Spain from producing the food that Europe imports.

In our ‘high innovation’ scenario, where alternative proteins come to represent two thirds of the meat
and dairy market by 2050, sharing the land dividend would have four benefits:
1. The ten European countries studied would become self-sufficient in food, in terms of net land use. 
2. Farmers would benefit from the carbon removal market by having the space to expand nature-rich, natural carbon sinks. These would avoid the need for engineered carbon removals, saving €21 billion a year by 2050 on the cost of meeting Europe’s carbon neutrality goals, equivalent to nearly half the EU’s Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) budget. 
3. The area of agroecological farmland would quadruple by 2050, which is more than is necessary to meet the EU Farm to Fork strategy’s goal of 25 per cent of land being certified organic.
4. Enough wildlife habitat would be created to restore so-called Annex I habitats (those identified as most in need of conservation) required by the EU’s Nature Restoration Law
