- Twenty per cent of farmed land in England produces just three per cent of the calories we grow.
- As our analysis shows, using the least productive ten per cent of land for natural habitat and carbon removal would raise bird populations by 48 per cent by 2050 and save half the carbon needed by 2035 from the whole land system.

Support #farmers  to keep food yields high on productive land while using much less fertiliser and pesticide: reductions of a quarter are possible without loss of production.
