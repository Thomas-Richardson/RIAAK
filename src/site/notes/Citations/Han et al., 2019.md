- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">7 studies on overall cancer mortality for unprocessed meat found an RR of 0.93 </mark>(0.91-0.94) for a reduction in 3 portions per week (360 unprocessed, 150 processed) <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">for processed: 0.92</mark>, 0.89-0.1.04, 3 studies. One serving was 120 g for unprocessed red meat, 50 g for processed meat
## Background:
Cancer incidence has continuously increased over the past few centuries and represents a major health burden worldwide.
## Purpose:
To evaluate the possible causal relationship between intake of red and processed meat and cancer mortality and incidence.
## Data Sources:
Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Web of Science, CINAHL, and ProQuest from inception until July 2018 and MEDLINE from inception until April 2019 without language restrictions.
## Study Selection:
Cohort studies that included more than 1000 adults and reported the association between consumption of unprocessed red and processed meat and cancer mortality and incidence.
## Data Extraction:
Teams of 2 reviewers independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias; 1 reviewer evaluated the certainty of evidence, which was confirmed or revised by the senior reviewer.
## Data Synthesis:
<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Of 118 articles (56 cohorts) with more than 6 million participants, 73 articles were eligible for the doseâ€“response meta-analyses, 30 addressed cancer mortality, and 80 reported cancer incidence. Low-certainty evidence suggested that an intake reduction of 3 servings of unprocessed meat per week was associated with a very small reduction in overall cancer mortality over a lifetime. Evidence of low to very low certainty suggested that each intake reduction of 3 servings of processed meat per week was associated with very small decreases in overall cancer mortality over a lifetime; prostate cancer mortality; and incidence of esophageal, colorectal, and breast cancer.</mark>
## Conclusion:
The possible absolute effects of red and processed meat consumption on cancer mortality and incidence are very small, and the certainty of evidence is low to very low.
