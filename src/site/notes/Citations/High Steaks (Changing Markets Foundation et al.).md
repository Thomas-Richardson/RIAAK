This report does not contain an executive summary. The following is a summary of the document.

*   **Agriculture is the EU's largest source of methane:** The agricultural sector is responsible for 53% of the EU's domestic methane emissions, primarily from livestock. The waste sector accounts for 27% and the energy sector for 13%.
*   **Livestock's dominant role:** Within the agricultural sector, the digestive process of ruminants (enteric fermentation) and manure are the main sources of methane. Cattle alone are responsible for 70.4% of methane emissions from EU livestock agriculture.
*   **Current policies are insufficient:** Under a business-as-usual scenario, the EU is projected to reduce methane emissions by only 13.4% by 2030. This falls significantly short of its 30% commitment under the Global Methane Pledge and the 45% reduction scientists say is needed to align with a 1.5°C climate target.
*   **Dietary change has the highest impact:** The report highlights that policies driving a consumer switch to healthier diets with less meat and dairy offer the largest potential for methane reduction. A shift to healthier diets alone could cut total EU methane emissions by 15-19%.
*   **Impact of healthier diets:** A healthier diet, as defined in the study, involves EU consumers halving their consumption of beef and pork and reducing milk consumption by 25%. This would cut methane emissions from the livestock sector by 29-37%.
*   **Reduction Scenarios:** A study by CE Delft outlined three scenarios:
    *   **Pledge Scenario (30% target):** A 26-34% reduction is achievable if 10% of consumers switch to healthier diets, alongside technical measures in farming, waste, and energy.
    *   **Science Scenario (45% target):** A 38-47% reduction is achievable if 50% of consumers switch to healthier diets.
    *   **Maximum Potential Scenario:** A 49-68% reduction is possible if 100% of consumers switch to healthier diets and all available technical measures are implemented.
*   **Agriculture holds the key:** The report concludes that tackling emissions in the agriculture sector is essential for the EU to meet its climate goals, with the sector having the potential to deliver the biggest reductions—up to 36% of the EU's total methane emissions.
*   **Policy Recommendations:** The report urges the EU and its Member States to:
    1.  **Set binding targets:** Establish an EU-wide methane reduction target for the agriculture sector that is aligned with science.
    2.  **Promote healthier diets:** Implement policies under the Sustainable Food Systems Framework Law to make plant-rich foods more accessible and affordable, using tools like public procurement and fiscal measures (e.g., taxes on meat products).
    3.  **Regulate companies:** Impose binding methane reporting and reduction targets on corporations, including their supply chain (scope 3) emissions.
