Hirvonen, K., Bai, Y., Headey, D., & Masters, W. A. (2020). Affordability of the EAT–Lancet reference diet: a global analysis. _The Lancet Global Health_, _8_(1), e59-e66.

Rescaled to £: £2.34 a day, IQR £1.98 - £3.16 in 2011, which rescaled to 2023 pounds is: £3.52, £2.98 - £4.75.

### Background
The EAT–_Lancet_ Commission drew on all available nutritional and environmental evidence to construct the first global benchmark diet capable of sustaining health and protecting the planet, but it did not assess dietary affordability. We used food price and household income data to estimate affordability of EAT–_Lancet_ benchmark diets, as a first step to guiding interventions to improve diets around the world.

### Methods
We obtained <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">retail prices from 2011 for 744 foods in 159 countries</mark>, collected under the International Comparison Program. We used these data to identify the most affordable foods to meet EAT–_Lancet_ targets. We compared total diet cost per day to each country's mean per capita household income, calculated the proportion of people for whom the most affordable EAT–_Lancet_ diet exceeds total income, and also measured affordability relative to a least-cost diet that meets essential nutrient requirements.

### Findings
<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">The most affordable EAT–_Lancet_ diets cost a global median of US$2·84 per day (IQR 2·41–3·16) in 2011</mark>, of which the largest share was the cost of fruits and vegetables (31·2%), followed by legumes and nuts (18·7%), meat, eggs, and fish (15·2%), and dairy (13·2%). This diet costs a small fraction of average incomes in high-income countries but is not affordable for the world's poor. We estimated that <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">the cost of an EAT–_Lancet_ diet exceeded household per capita income for at least 1·58 billion people. The EAT–_Lancet_ diet is also more expensive than the minimum cost of nutrient adequacy, on average, by a mean factor of 1·60 (IQR 1·41–1·78)</mark>.

### Interpretation
Current diets differ greatly from EAT–_Lancet_ targets. Improving diets is affordable in many countries but for many people would require some combination of higher income, nutritional assistance, and lower prices. Data and analysis for the cost of healthier foods are needed to inform both local interventions and systemic changes.
