[Conservatism predicts lapses from vegetarian/vegan diets to meat consumption (through lower social justice concerns and social support) - ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0195666316308923) 

[[Citations/Dhont and Hodson, 2014\|Dhont and Hodson, 2014]]

For every 1-point increase in a 5-point scale (liberal to conservative), there was a 26% increase in the odds that one lapsed back to eating meat. Conservatism predicted quitting vegan controlling for age, education, and gender. This is because cons a) did not adopt veg\*n diets for reasons of social justice, such as animal welfare; and (b) felt poorly supported in their social circles (family and friends). It was not because they craved meat more, or worried more about their health.
