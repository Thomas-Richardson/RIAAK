A study conducted by Faunalytics and Animal Equality supports the effectiveness of Animal Equality’s video outreach for reducing consumption and shifting attitudes. Over 3,000 people on U.S. college campuses participated in a randomized controlled trial. Participants either watched a video about pig factory farming (on a tablet or via a VR headset) or did not watch a video (the control group). 

Compared to the control condition, participants who watched either video had stronger anti-pork attitudes immediately after watching and one month later. The videos also had the desired effect on pork consumption: relative to the control condition, participants who saw one of the videos ate marginally less pork. For example, 38% of people who watched the 360-degree VR video and 37% who watched the 2D video said they hadn’t eaten any pork in the last month, versus 33% in the control group. The results suggest that watching a video about farmed pigs makes the average person’s attitudes more anti-pork, and that attitude shift leads them to reduce their pork consumption.
