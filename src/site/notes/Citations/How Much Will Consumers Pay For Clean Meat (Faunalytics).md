When people were asked to tell us the most they would be willing to pay for clean meat versions of specific beef, chicken and fish products, about 40% indicated they would be willing to pay more for clean vs. conventional products.

*   For beef, 14% percent of respondents were willing to pay a premium of 25% or more. Twenty-five percent were willing to pay a premium up to 24.9%.
*   For chicken, 22% of respondents were willing to pay premiums of 25% or more—and a similar number for fish. Nineteen percent were willing to pay a premium up to 24.9% for each.
*   About a quarter of respondents indicated they would pay less for clean meat vs. conventional and 13-14% would buy the conventional meat product instead of the clean meat version regardless of price.

These results likely overstate willingness to pay for clean meat somewhat. First, because the study included positive messages that would not appear at the point of sale. Also, people claim that they are willing to pay more in response to survey questions than they are when actually spending their money. Despite these limitations, Faunalytics believes the results are encouraging for clean meat producers, marketers and investors.
