Research shows that consumers often view health as a key benefit—and a major driver—of plant-based meat purchases. Yet, “healthy” can mean different things to different people. To explore these nuances, we examined U.S. consumers’ health beliefs, needs, and behaviors, then compared them with verified purchase data to uncover opportunities to strengthen plant-based meat’s value proposition.

### Key findings

- **Consumers say health drives choice—and it does.**
  - Healthy eating is both reality and aspiration—not every item in every meal is (or has to be) healthy—but consumers who say they care about health spend less on “unhealthy” foods and spend more on “healthy” foods than others.
  - While taste and price are critical to getting into the consideration set, consumers also need compelling reasons to switch to plant-based meat, and for many, that reason is health.
  - Those who think plant-based meat is healthy spend more on it than those who don’t.
- **Plant-based meat is generally seen as healthy.**
  - Overall, many consumers view plant-based meat as “somewhat” or “very” healthy. Strong health associations include high protein, low fat and cholesterol, and free of antibiotics/hormones.
- **Nutrition labels and ingredients shape perceptions.**
  - Health cues come from ingredients, processing, and nutrient content, but “freshness” dominates for meat, whether plant-based or conventional. Packaging design and external sources (e.g., social media) are also influential.
  - Some consumers feel that plant-based meat is processed, however, those who say they avoid processed foods don’t buy less plant-based meat (but do buy less processed foods like chips and candy).

### Unlocking demand

Boosting consumer health perceptions of plant-based meat appears likely to have the biggest impact on current buyers in the near term.

Plant-based meat buyers report more health-conscious attitudes and info-seeking behaviors than non-buyers. They are more likely to indicate that further improvement on key health attributes would motivate them to eat plant-based meat more often. Current buyers are estimated to eat plant-based meat two to three times a month on average, leaving significant room for growth if their demand is better met.

Non-buyers are much more concerned about taste and price, and improvements on these fundamental attributes are needed to drive trial. However, once those attributes are delivered, non-buyers are interested in many of the same health benefits as current buyers.

**Consumer segments provide a framework to prioritize**

While health is a key part of the plant-based meat value proposition for many, the specifics vary. For example, some individuals want to manage their long-term health and avoid issues like heart disease, while others closely examine specific nutrients and ingredients, and some prioritize protein. Selecting a target consumer segment can help identify which health attributes might be most effective to address. To learn more, check out our plant-based meat consumer segmentation.
