### **Summary**

#### **S.1 Main research question**

This main research question is to study the effects of a transition from a conventional broiler production system to the ECC broiler production system on the economics, the environment and food safety in selected EU countries. For the economic component, we focused on the production costs of conventional and ECC broilers at farm level and after slaughter and processing in six EU countries. The main broiler producing countries are Poland, Germany, Spain, France, Italy and the Netherlands. In the environmental component, we focused on comparing conventional and ECC broiler production in the Netherlands for carbon footprint, land use and phosphorus excretion. The results are calculated for every link in the production chain and the total production chain until slaughter and processing. In the area of food safety, we looked at the differences in the use of antibiotics between conventional and slow-growing broiler chickens in the Netherlands.

#### **S.2 Message**

**2.1 Economics**

**The Netherlands**
For the situation in the Netherlands we made a detailed comparison of conventional production (with thinning) and the ECC with and without thinning¹. The total costs per kg live weight in the Netherlands for conventional broilers is 103.7 cents. For ECC, the total costs are 124.6 (with thinning) and 131.5 (without thinning). For ECC, the production costs are 20.9 cents (20.2%) higher with thinning and 27.8 cents (26.8%) higher without thinning. This increase of costs is mainly caused by higher housing costs (+7.4 to +10.9 cents per kg live weight), feed costs (+6.8 cents per kg live weight) and labour (+2.7 to +4.4 cents per kg live weight). The increase in housing costs is caused by the lower stocking density. The increase in feed costs can be explained by the higher feed conversion rate of slower-growing broiler breeds. The increase in labour costs of ECC is due to the lower stocking density.

**Other EU countries**
For five other EU countries, we calculated the production costs of the conventional system and ECC with thinning. Based on information on the main economic parameters, we made a comparison for Germany, France, Italy, Spain and Poland. In these countries there is a difference in investment for building a poultry house and costs of labour. In Table S.1, we show for each country the additional costs of ECC and the difference compared to the Netherlands (in cents per kg live weight). All other countries show a smaller cost increase for ECC compared to conventional broilers. In Germany the stocking density in the conventional systems is lower because of legislation. In Spain, the stocking density in conventional systems is lower than the Netherlands due to the warm climate. Spain, Italy and especially Poland have the advantage of lower housing and labour costs. In those situations, the impact of lowering the density is smaller.

¹ Thinning is common practice in broiler production in which part of the broiler flock is delivered to the slaughterhouse before the end of the growing cycle; thinning is typically carried out by delivering 20 to 30% of the broilers approximately one week before the final delivery.

**Table S.1 Production costs at farm level (cents per kg live weight): comparison of ECC and conventional (both thinning) relative to the Netherlands.**

| Country | Additional costs ECC system (cents per kg LW) | Difference with NL (cents per kg LW) | Main factors for difference in costs |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| The Netherlands | +20.9 | | |
| Germany | +19.9 | -1.0 | Lower stocking density in conventional system (legislation) |
| France | +19.4 | -1.5 | Lower final live weight |
| Italy | +19.2 | -1.7 | Lower housing and labour costs |
| Spain | +18.3 | -2.6 | Lower density in conventional (climate) lower housing and labour costs |
| Poland | +17.8 | -3.1 | Lower housing and labour costs |

From the broiler farm, the broilers are transported to the slaughterhouse. After slaughter, the product is the carcass, and costs are expressed per kg carcass weight. The next step is further processing into final consumer products such as breast fillet, wings and legs. The total weight of these products is called meat. The costs are expressed per kg of meat. Table S.2 gives the production costs of conventional and ECC as average of these six EU countries at farm level (live weight), after slaughter (carcass weight) and after processing (meat). Table S.2 shows that the increase in cents per kg of meat is lowest in Poland (42.7 cents), while the percentage increase is lowest in Spain and France (19%).

To summarise, we give the production costs of conventional and ECC on average (unweighted) in six EU countries at farm level (live weight), after slaughter (carcass weight) and after processing (meat). Figure S.1 gives the results.

**(Image of Figure S.1)** A bar chart showing the average production costs for conventional vs ECC broilers across six EU countries.
- **Farm (LW):** Conventional costs are 104.3 cents/kg, ECC costs are 123.6 cents/kg, an increase of +18.5%.
- **Slaughter (CW):** Conventional costs are 181.7 cents/kg, ECC costs are 210.7 cents/kg, an increase of +15.9%.
- **Processing (meat):** Conventional costs are 237.4 cents/kg, ECC costs are 283.6 cents/kg, an increase of +19.4%.

The increase after a transition to ECC at farm level is 18.5%. After slaughter the increase is 15.9% and after processing the increase is 19.4%.

**S2.2 Environment**
Environmental impacts (greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), land use, phosphorous excretion) were estimated for all stages until slaughterhouse and processing. Diets were composed for different stages of conventional and ECC broiler production. This was done for the situation in the Netherlands.

Results showed that environmental impact increased with the transition from conventional to ECC. For GHG emissions including land use change (LUC) emissions, this increase was 6.3% at farm level per kg live weight. After slaughter the increase was 7.2% per kg carcass weight. After processing, the increase was 11.0% per kg meat. This increase was mainly due to a higher feed conversion. Figure S.2 gives the different components and the total at farm level (per kg live weight). Figure S.3 gives the different components and the total after slaughter and processing (per kg meat).

**(Image of Figure S.2)** A stacked bar chart showing GHG emissions at the farm level.
- **Conventional:** 2.28 kg CO₂ equivalents per kg live weight.
- **ECC:** 2.43 kg CO₂ equivalents per kg live weight.
- This is an increase of +6.3%.
- The largest component of emissions for both is Feed Production, followed by Land Use Change.

**(Image of Figure S.3)** A stacked bar chart showing GHG emissions after slaughter and processing.
- **Conventional:** 4.02 kg CO₂ equivalents per kg meat.
- **ECC:** 4.47 kg CO₂ equivalents per kg meat.
- This is an increase of +11.0%.
- The largest component of emissions for both is Feed Production, followed by Land Use Change.

Land use is related to production of feed ingredients. Higher feed intake at farm level results in higher land use (m² crop equivalent). The transition from conventional to ECC resulted in an increase in land use of 9.4% per kg live weight, 10.5% per kg carcass weight and 14.4% per kg meat.

Phosphorus excretion (grams of P) at the broiler farm is higher for ECC compared to conventional. The transition from conventional to ECC resulted in an increase in phosphorus excretion of 30.6% per kg live weight, 31.9% per kg carcass weight and 36.7% per kg meat.

**S2.3 Food safety/Antibiotics use**
A transition from conventional to ECC systems will have a positive impact on antibiotic use. The lower treatment probability of slower growing flocks is likely a combination of the effect of a slower growth rate and a lower stocking density. In the Netherlands between 2022 and 2024, the number of defined daily dosage per animal per year was 10 to 12 for conventional broilers flocks and below 2 for slower-growing broiler flocks. It can be expected that a transition from conventional to ECC will reduce the use of antibiotics by 80 to 85%.

#### **S.3 Methodology**

First, the production standards of the conventional and European Chicken Commitment (ECC) system are identified for each country. The production standards of the conventional system are based on the minimum legal requirements set by the European Commission (Council Directive 2007/43/EC). The standards of the ECC system are based on the requirements described by the Eurogroup for animals. These requirements do not differ between EU countries. Second, the production parameters are determined based on the identified production standards. Examples of production parameters are feed conversion rate, weight at delivery and mortality rate. Third, the impact on the economy, environment and food safety is calculated. The base year for the calculations is 2024. The production costs are based on production parameters and prices. The environmental impact is calculated using a life cycle assessment. The impact on food safety was calculated using data on antibiotic use at farms in the Netherlands for conventional and slower-growing broilers. The system boundary depends on the impact that is being analysed. For the environmental impact, the system boundary extends from cradle to slaughterhouse. For the economic impact, the boundary includes the broiler farm and slaughterhouse. For antibiotic use, the boundary is a broiler farm.
