# Imports to Meet Swiss Animal Welfare Standards — Exact Summary (with key stats)

**What the ask is:**  
Introduce a Swiss law requiring **all animal-product imports** to meet **Swiss animal welfare standards**. Some products would be effectively **prohibited** (e.g., **foie gras**, **fur**). For remaining imports, welfare would need to match Swiss rules (e.g., **broiler densities**, mutilation limits, **humane slaughter**).

---

## Why it matters (theory of change)
1) **De facto bans** where Swiss standards can’t be met (e.g., foie gras, fur).  
2) **Upgrading foreign production** for imports that continue, wherever Swiss rules are **stricter** than exporting countries’.

---

## Where imports come from (2019)
- **Top 13 exporters = 80.5%** of Swiss animal-product imports.  
- Of these, by World Animal Protection “farmed animals” ratings:
  - **55.2%** of imports from countries **rated lower than Switzerland**  
  - **15.2%** **not assessed**  
  - **10.1%** **same or better** than Switzerland  
- Country shares (selected): Germany **17%**, Italy **12.7%**, Netherlands **8.1%**, Ireland **3.8%**, Austria **3.7%**, New Zealand **3.3%**, Norway **3.3%**, Denmark **3.1%**, Australia **2.5%**, **USA 2.2%**, **Vietnam 2.2%**, Brazil **2.2%**.

## Swiss vs EU law – headline gaps
- **Laying hens:** Switzerland **banned all cages in 1992**. EU still has **49%** of hens in **enriched cages**; EU has **announced** a **cage ban by 2027**; Switzerland still imports some **caged eggs** (must be **labelled**).
- **Broilers:** EU allows up to **42 kg/m²**; many countries **33–39 kg/m²**; France/Belgium/Netherlands often **>39 kg/m²**. Switzerland caps at **30 kg/m²**.
- **Pigs:** EU permits tail docking (not “routine”), yet **~77%** of pigs are **routinely docked**. Switzerland **bans** tail docking; **<5%** docked.
- **Farmed fish:** EU has **no stun-before-slaughter requirement**; Switzerland requires **anaesthesia/stunning** with **specified methods**.

**Implication:** Many EU-sourced products are produced **below Swiss minimum legal standards**.

---

## Non-EU exporters – illustrative gaps
- **USA:** **2.2%** of imports (≈ **$44.7m**) with **E** rating; **no federal** broiler density limits, **no fish stunning** requirement, **no federal** battery-cage/sow-stall bans.  
- **Vietnam:** **2.2%** (mostly fish/crustaceans) with **G** rating; **no specific farmed-animal protections** beyond general anti-“mistreatment”.

---

## Public opinion & politics (tractability)
- **UK benchmarks:** Support for import bans on lower-welfare products at **84%** (BGAJ) and **75%** (RSPCA).  
- **Swiss precedent:** **Fair Food Initiative (2018)** failed **61.3%–38.7%** (turnout **37.52%**). Government cited **trade-law conflicts**.  
- **Takeaway:** Expect **moderate** chance of success; internal Swiss polling exists (not public).

---

## Legal feasibility (WTO/EFTA/EU)
- WTO **Article XX** exceptions (e.g., **public morals**, **natural resources**) have supported animal-welfare-linked measures:
  - **EU seal products ban** upheld as **public morals**.
  - **US shrimp/turtle** case upheld.  
- EU already requires imported meat to meet **equivalent slaughter standards**; an EU official indicated broader **welfare-equivalence** could be **WTO-compliant** on **ethical grounds**.  
- **Swiss cat-fur imports banned since 2006**; UK fur-ban idea has **72%** public support; **India (2017)** import ban on several furs; **Israel (2021)** fur sales ban (with limited exceptions).  
- Swiss-EU agriculture agreement would **need renegotiation**, but a **successful initiative is binding** on government to pursue it.

---

## Enforcement – practical considerations
- Government concerns: **foreign inspections** are time-consuming and require consent.  
- Easier where **all variants are cruel** (e.g., frog legs, shark fins).  
- **EU–Mercosur** shows **conditional tariffs** can be enforced (eggs meeting EU rules).  
- To avoid **producer bias**, put **equivalence certification** with an **independent body**; use **process standards** (analogy: organic).  
- **Compliance costs** for cross-border process standards can be **<1%** of product value.  
- **Cross-border shopping risk:** For foie gras, **38%** of consumers would **buy abroad**; risk varies by product and price gap (e.g., **cage-free vs caged** eggs).

---

## Alternatives to a ban
- **Higher tariffs for lower-welfare imports:** Politically difficult; **MFN** constraints; Switzerland already has **very high tariffs** (**~110%** animal products; **133.2%** dairy).  
- **Conditional liberalisation:** **Cut tariffs** only for imports meeting **Swiss standards** (cf. **EU–Mercosur eggs**). Less controversial but **less impactful**; constrained where FTAs already grant low tariffs.

---

## CEA – headline results
- **~90%** of the ask’s value comes from reducing **lower-welfare chicken and fish** imports; **~9%** from reducing **caged eggs**.  
- About **100× more chickens** imported than sheep → massive numbers.  
- Potential to improve the lives of **tens of millions** of animals annually.  
- Main uncertainty: **fish import volumes** and **farmed vs wild-caught** split (order-of-magnitude range), but the ask remains **more impactful** than a “cruel products”-only ban and likely **Pareto-dominates** if those products are also captured.

---

## Bottom line
- Switzerland **imports a large share** of what it consumes; for **fish**, domestic production is only **~2%** of consumption.  
- Requiring **imports to meet Swiss standards** would likely **eliminate** the worst products and **ratchet up** welfare on the rest.  
- **Legal pathways** exist; **public support** appears **promising** though not guaranteed.  
- Given scale, tractability, and precedent, this is assessed as the **most promising** Swiss initiative in expectation.
