Faunalytics’ experiment investigated whether messages and donor characteristics can increase donations to farmed and companion animals.

### Key Findings

*   **Farmed animals received almost as much money as companion animals when donors were given the opportunity to support them**: **86% of the amount**. This suggests that farmed animal charities may benefit from just getting their message out more. However, it is worth noting that the farmed animal appeals in this study were “diet-neutral”: There was no mention of diet, veganism, or the donors’ behavior. We recommend that donation appeals to a general audience (vs. just vegans) focus on the reduction of animal suffering and not refer to human diet or lifestyle, because it sidesteps the “meat paradox”: the fact that many people care about animals but still eat them. It would likely be hard for those individuals to provide financial support to a cause that explicitly works against their own behavior.

*   **People who have previously donated to any animal charity gave 92% more money to farmed and companion animals than people who had not.** Therefore, the more it costs a charity to access each potential donor, the more cost-effective it becomes to tap into this group. For farmed animal charities in particular, previous donors to any animal cause are a valuable target group, as most will likely be new to farmed animal support.

*   **There was no difference in donations whether the appeal used an identifiable victim or statistical victims**. This finding is similar to previous research with wild animals (Thomas-Walters & Raihani, 2016). Surprisingly, though, even appeals with no descriptive text at all performed as well as the rest. This finding points to minimal appeals as the most cost-effective messaging strategy for donations, as it suggests that lengthier ads may be unnecessary.
