The [Institute for Sustainable Futures](https://www.uts.edu.au/isf) at the University of Technology Sydney (UTS)

Representative sample of 1014 Australians. Asked about their experience with and perceptions of plant-based foods. Questions posed included the presentation of images of currently available supermarket products and whether the respondent thought they were: a plant-based meat product, an animal-based meat product, or whether they were undecided/unsure.

Incorrect choices are highly unlikely to occur as a result of misleading labelling, and that increased exposure to plant-based meat substitutes and their labels reduces the risk of incorrect choices even further. The survey results also indicated that many consumers are keen to eat more plant-based products, but that the incidence of consumer confusion in this product category is significantly higher than when seeking meat-based products.

- There is no widespread confusion among Australian consumers. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Only 4% of people surveyed inadvertently purchased a plant-based product</mark> because of confusion with labels. Of those respondents who purchased plant-based products believing them to be animal products, <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">67% indicated this was because they were in a hurry or distracted and did not read the product label</mark>.
- Plant-based consumers are far more likely to buy a product in error than the other way around, with 41% of plant-based respondents having bought a product to later discover it contains animal ingredients.
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">64% of respondents find generic terms like ‘meat-free’ and ‘meat-less’ helpful</mark> to differentiate if products contain meat or not, and <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">57% find specific terms like ‘beef-free’, ‘plant-based chicken’, and ‘bacon-style’ helpful</mark> to know if products contain meat or not.
- 22% of respondents indicated they want to eat more plant-based foods, and reduce the amount of animal products they consume, and
- 26% of respondents indicated they are likely to substitute a plant-based product for an animal product in the next 12 months.
