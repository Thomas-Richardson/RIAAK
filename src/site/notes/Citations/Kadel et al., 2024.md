Kadel, P., Heist, N., Paulheim, H., & Mata, J. (2024). From Pixels to Palate: Communication Around# vegan on Instagram and Its Relation With Eating Intentions. _Appetite_, 107518.

- In <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">four studies</mark>, we first explored and described the information environment the platform Instagram presents related to veganism. 
- Second, we examined how engaging with this environment is associated with offline eating intentions via psychological mechanisms. 
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">We scraped datasets of Instagram posts tagged with \#vegan (44,316 posts in total)</mark> and 
	- Employed network analysis with their hashtags (Study 1)
	- Clustering with images and sentiment analysis with texts (Study 2). 
	- Studies 3 (_N_ = 117) and 4 (_N_ = 251) used online surveys to investigate associations between different forms of engaging with social media content, psychological constructs, and offline eating intentions. 
- Posts about veganism were frequently related to food, health and fitness, cosmetics, and photography. 
- Images most often depicted food (34.7%), non-food products (30.4%), people (7.9%), and animals (2.0%). 
- The sentiment of most posts was positive. 
- Being exposed to Instagram content about veganism was more strongly and consistently associated with eating intentions than active forms of engagement. Attitude and self-identity emerged as the most relevant mechanisms for these effects.

- Their clustering didn't seem to find much tbh.
- Their study 3 was also a bit crap: 100 participants and nearly all were vegan or mostly vegan so no wonder they found no effects for liking veganism!
