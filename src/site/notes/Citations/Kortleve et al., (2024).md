Kortleve, A. J., Mogollón, J. M., Harwatt, H., & Behrens, P. (2024). Over 80% of the European Union’s Common Agricultural Policy supports emissions-intensive animal products. _Nature Food_, _5_(4), 288-292.

The European Union’s Common Agricultural Policy strongly influences the European Union’s food system via agricultural subsidies. Linking global physical input–output datasets with public subsidy data reveals that current allocation favours animal-based foods, which uses 82% of the European Union’s agricultural subsidies (38% directly and 44% for animal feed). Subsidy intensity (€ kg −1 ) for animal-based foods approximately doubles after feed inclusion. The same animal-based foods are associated with 84% of embodied greenhouse gas emissions of EU food production while supplying 35% of EU calories and 65% of proteins

Here we investigate how public funds support and promote animal agriculture by tracking how EU27 + UK (the 27 EU members in 2020 plus the United Kingdom) CAP subsidies flow across the global food supply chain. We use the physical-flow Food and Agriculture Biomass Input–Output (FABIO) database 19 coupled with EU CAP subsidies using the Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN) Public Database

They actually only use data from 2013
