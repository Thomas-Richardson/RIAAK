**Keeping livestock healthy and well cared for improves animal, human, environment and economic health**

## Case studies
Subjecting chickens to stress on their journeys to slaughter increases their levels of shedding of Campylobacter, a bacteria
which can cause diarrhoeal disease in people who go on to eat the under-cooked meat

Poor livestock handling and transportation lead to injuries and bruising in animals and subsequent losses of meat post-slaughter. For example, in Uruguay such practices resulted in an average 900g of meat lost per animal slaughtered.
