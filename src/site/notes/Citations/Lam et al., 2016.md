- Between 2015 and 2016, we collected and synthesized publicly available information on IFAP in ten LMICs, focusing specifically on the beef, pork, and chicken sectors. The countriesâ€”Brazil, China, Ethiopia, India, Kenya, Mexico, Myanmar, Turkey, Uganda, and Vietnam. 
- IFAP production practices appear to be the most established in Brazil and China
- In many countries, there appeared to be <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">substantial national governmental support for industrializing food animal production</mark>. In some countries, it is an explicit component of their strategy for economic development. 
- We found evidence that <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">LMIC governments and companies are working to increase exports</mark> to meet demand for animal products abroad, and <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">imports of feed ingredients</mark>, veterinary products, and other inputs for a growing domestic animal agriculture sector.
- A worrying trend is that there is often <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">insufficient, unenforced, or outright missing regulation</mark> on the harms of CAFOs
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Misuse of antibiotic drugs</mark> due to lack of good vets and vet schools
