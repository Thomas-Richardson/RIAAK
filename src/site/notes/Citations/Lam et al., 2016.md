- Between 2015 and 2016, we collected and synthesized publicly available information on IFAP in ten LMICs, focusing specifically on the beef, pork, and chicken sectors. The countries—Brazil, China, Ethiopia, India, Kenya, Mexico, Myanmar, Turkey, Uganda, and Vietnam. 
- IFAP production practices appear to be the most established in Brazil and China
- In many countries, there appeared to be <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">substantial national governmental support for industrializing food animal production</mark>. In some countries, it is an explicit component of their strategy for economic development. 
- We found evidence that <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">LMIC governments and companies are working to increase exports</mark> to meet demand for animal products abroad, and <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">imports of feed ingredients</mark>, veterinary products, and other inputs for a growing domestic animal agriculture sector.
- A worrying trend is that there is often <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">insufficient, unenforced, or outright missing regulation</mark> on the harms of CAFOs
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Misuse of antibiotic drugs</mark> due to lack of good vets and vet schools
