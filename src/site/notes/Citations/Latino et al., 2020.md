- historical evidences from Asia and Latin America suggest that the perishable character of animal products and limited infrastructure will likely induce production to initially locate close to demand. Accordingly, an increase in the number of mid- and large-scale operators in peri-urban areas is to be expected.

- Today, African [livestock production](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/livestock-farming "Learn more about livestock production from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") is unable to satisfy local demand, with about one third of all countries in the continent importing more than 20 percent of their total meat supply. Projections picture SSA unable to meet consumersâ€™ demand if current yield trends continue; thus, the food import bill for many African countries is also projected to increase.
- high density of animals in urban areas may easily pollute soil, water and air, further exacerbating the negative impact of livestock on public health.
