## Abstract
- Animal source foods (ASF) such as dairy, eggs, fish and meat are an important source of high-quality nutrients. Lack of ASF in diets can result in developmental disorders including stunting, anemia, poor cognitive and motor development. ASF are more effective in preventing stunting than other foods and promoting ASF consumption in low- and middle-income countries could help improve health, particularly among pregnant women and young children. Production and consumption of ASF are, however, also associated with potential food safety risks. Strengthening of food control systems, informed by quantitative assessments of the disease burden associated with ASF is necessary to meet global nutrition goals. 
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">We present the human disease burden associated with 13 pathogens (bacteria and parasites) in ASF, </mark>based on an analysis of global burden of foodborne disease (FBD) estimates of the WHO Foodborne Disease Burden Epidemiology Reference Group (FERG). 
- The FBD burden of these pathogens was combined with estimates of the proportion of disease transmitted by eight main groups of ASF. Uncertainty in all estimates was accounted for by Monte Carlo simulation. 
- In 2010, the global burden of ASF was 168 (95% uncertainty interval (UI 137â€“219) Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) per 100,000 population, which is approximately <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">35% of the estimated total burden of FBD</mark>. 
- Main pathogens contributing to this burden included non-typhoidal _Salmonella enterica_, _Taenia solium_ (pig tapeworm), and _Campylobacter_ spp. 
- The proportion of FBD burden associated with ASF varied considerably between subregions and between countries within subregions. Likewise, the contribution of different pathogens and ASF groups varied strongly between subregions. 
- Pathogens with a localized distribution included _T_. _solium_ and fishborne trematodes. 
- Pathogens with a global distribution included non-typhoidal _S_. _enterica_, _Campylobacter_ spp., _Toxoplasma gondii_, and _Mycobacterium bovis_. 
- Control methods exist for many hazards associated with ASF, and their implementation is linked to economic development and effective food safety systems.

## Notes
- ASF account for approximately 35% of the total burden of foodborne diseases caused by all food groups.
- Specific pathogens of interest, in terms of ASF, included non-typhoidal Salmonella, Campylobacter and Taenia Solium. Together, these three pathogens account for 70% of the total global burden associated with ASF.
- While ASF are valuable sources of nutrients that can prevent stunting in small children, they are also a key cause of diarrhoea which is the strongest predictor of stunting.
- Mycobacterium bovis (the causative agent of tuberculosis in cattle) is still an important burden in Africa, and causes most food bourne disease from dairy in Africa
- Very little foreign aid to tackle food bourne disease
- Approximately 90% of the FBD burden of _Campylobacter_ spp. was attributed to ASF, a disease which is [among the most important pathogens](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(18)30349-8/fulltext) associated with Environmental Enteric Dysfunction and stunting.
