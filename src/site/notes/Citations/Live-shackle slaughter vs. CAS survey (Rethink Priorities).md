Rethink Priorities conducted a survey to see how live shackle slaughter resonates with consumers to engender support for reforming this practice. We also tested whether controlled atmosphere systems are a popular alternative.

We found that clear majorities of Americans (including among those who eat chicken) agree that live-shackle slaughter is inhumane and would switch brands to avoid live-shackle slaughter or pay more for meat produced using controlled atmosphere systems instead.

*   66% of Americans agree that live-shackle slaughter is inhumane
*   68% of Americans would change the brand of meat they buy to one that does not use live-shackle slaughter
*   58% of Americans would sign a petition to ban live-shackle slaughter
*   71% of Americans prefer controlled atmosphere systems over live-shackle slaughter
*   81% of Americans would buy meat produced using controlled atmosphere systems
*   63% of Americans would pay more for meat produced using controlled atmosphere systems rather than live-shackle slaughter
