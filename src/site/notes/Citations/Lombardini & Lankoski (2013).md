This paper discusses the use of forced restriction of food choice as an instrument of food policy by using the mandatory <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Helsinki School District weekly vegetarian day</mark> as a natural experiment. 
- Overall, the results show that <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">the initiative produced a mixture of intended and unintended effects</mark>. 
- On vegetarian days, there were clear signs of non-compliance in the short term, manifested as a decrease in the participation in school lunches and in the amount of food taken to the plate and as an increase in plate waste. 
- In the medium term, the only sign of non-compliance was a decrease in the amount of food taken to the plate. 
- The difference between the short- and medium-term effects can be interpreted as a weakening of non-compliance, as a change in the way it manifested itself, or a combination of both. 
- The effects of the vegetarian day differed between school levels. In the short term, the clearest indications of non-compliance were found in lower-secondary schools. However, these schools also registered positive spillover effects in the medium term. 
- The best way to reduce the unintended effects of a policy involving forced choice restriction depends on the causes of such effects.
	- In the case of psychological reactance, default options may be preferable to forced choice restriction. 
	- For hedonic dislike, menu development should be prioritized, and moral suasion and information campaigns may help where non-compliance stems from a disagreement with the objectives and effectiveness of the intervention. 
- Thus, forced choice restriction should be accompanied by detailed data collection to understand the possible causes of intended and unintended effects and to tailor the intervention to the target group.
