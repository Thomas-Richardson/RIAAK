## Abstract

Background and objectives: Dietary changes are necessary to improve population health and meet environmental sustainability targets. The present study aimed to analyse the impact of in-store promotional activities implemented in major UK supermarkets on purchases of healthier and more sustainable foods. 

Methods: <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Three natural experiments</mark> examined <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">the impact of promotional activities</mark> on (a) no-added-sugar (NAS) plant-based milk (in <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">200 stores over 3 weeks</mark>), (b) products targeted during a <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">‘Veganuary’ event (in 96 stores over 4 weeks</mark>), and (c) seasonal fruit (in 100 non-randomised intervention and 100 matched control stores over 16 weeks). Data were provided on store-level product sales, in units sold and monetary value (GBP), aggregated weekly. The predominant socioeconomic position (SEP) of the store population was provided by the retailer. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">The primary analyses used interrupted time series and multivariable hierarchical mixed-effects models</mark>. 

Results: Sales of both promotion-targeted and overall NAS plant-based milks during the promotional period increased (targeted food: +126 units, 95% CI: 105, 148; overall: +307 units, 95% CI: 264, 349). The increase was greater in stores with predominately low SEP shoppers. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">During Veganuary, sales increased for plant-based foods on promotion</mark> (+60 units, 95% CI: 37, 84), <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">but not for the sales of plant-based foods overall</mark> (dairy alternatives: −1131 units, 95% CI: −5821, 3559; meat alternatives: 1403 units, 95% CI: −749, 3554). There was no evidence of a change in the weekly sales of promoted seasonal fruit products (assessed via ratio change in units sold: 0.01, 95% CI: 0.00–0.01), and overall fruit category sales slightly decreased in intervention stores relative to the control (ratio change in units sold: −0.01, 95% CI: −0.01, –0.00). <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">None of the promotional activities resulted in the continued purchase of promoted products after the intervention period was over. </mark>

Conclusion: Promotional activity (including prominent positioning and price promotions) related to healthier or more sustainable food products can have a short-term impact on what food consumers purchase. But interventions are short-lived and effects on behaviour are not sustained, suggesting these have limited value in the long-term goal to achieve healthier and more sustainable purchasing patterns.
