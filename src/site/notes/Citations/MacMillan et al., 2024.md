Between Autumn 2022 and Spring 2023, we discussed cultured meat with 80
farmers in seven focus groups

Most of the farmers in the focus groups reacted first as consumers or citizens rather
than producers. The issues they raised echoed wider public concerns â€“ is it safe, is
it natural, will it be healthy, who is in control and who benefits?
