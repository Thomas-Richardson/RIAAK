Mariotti, F., & Gardner, C. D. (2019). Dietary protein and amino acids in vegetarian dietsâ€”A review. _Nutrients_, _11_(11), 2661.

## Abstract
While animal products are rich in protein, the adequacy of dietary protein intake from vegetarian/vegan diets has long been controversial. In this review, we examine the protein and amino acid intakes from vegetarian diets followed by <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">adults in western countries</mark> and gather information in terms of adequacy for protein and amino acids requirements, using indirect and direct data to estimate nutritional status. We point out that <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">protein-rich foods, such as traditional legumes, nuts and seeds, are sufficient to achieve full protein adequacy in adults consuming vegetarian/vegan diets, while the question of any amino acid deficiency has been substantially overstated.</mark> Our review addresses the adequacy in changes to protein patterns in people newly transitioning to vegetarian diets. 
We also specifically address this in <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">older adults, where the issues linked to the protein adequacy of vegetarian diets are more complex. </mark>
This contrasts with <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">the situation in children where there are no specific concerns regarding protein adequacy because of their very high energy requirements compared to those of protein.</mark> Given the growing shifts in recommendations from nutrition health professionals for people to transition to more plant-based, whole-food diets, additional scientific evidence-based communications confirming the protein adequacy of vegetarian and vegan diets is warranted.
