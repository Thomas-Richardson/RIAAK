McPhedran, R., Zhuo, S., Zamperetti, L., & Gold, N. (2023). The effects of Veganuary on meal choices in workplace cafeterias: an interrupted time series analysis. _Behavioural Public Policy_, 1-20.

Meat-based food production has a detrimental impact on the environment and health. In response, Veganuary (an international non-profit organisation) encourages people to go vegan each January. We investigated the effects of a Veganuary campaign in workplace cafeterias which increased the availability and salience of plant-based products. We conducted an interrupted time series analysis on a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">large dataset from a UK catering company, which comprised 2,255,404 meals sold between 2016 and 2022, with Veganuary activity starting from 2019</mark>. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Analysis indicated that Veganuary activity had a positive effect on sales of vegan products in 2020, 2021 and 2022, estimated at an initial increase of 86–113% in the proportion of weekly sales (relative to the baseline, depending on year).</mark> <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">The effects of the 2020 and 2021 campaigns were still present – at approximately one third of their initial magnitude – one year following the campaigns.</mark> There was a positive effect on vegetarian products in 2019, 2021 and 2022; initial effects were smaller – 23–79% – due to higher levels of pre-campaign consumption. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">The effects of the 2019 and 2021 campaigns endured, with a small impact present after one year for 2019 and six months for 2021.</mark>
