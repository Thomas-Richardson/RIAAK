This report by The Food Foundation analyses meat consumption patterns in the UK, highlighting the significant health and environmental consequences of current diets and providing recommendations for shifting towards more plant-rich diets.

**Key Findings on Consumption:**

*   **High Overall Consumption:** The UK consumes twice as much meat as the global average (83kg per person per year vs. 44kg).
*   **Chicken Dominates:** Chicken is the most consumed meat, accounting for 42% of the total meat eaten in the UK.
*   **High Processed Meat Intake:** Almost a third (29%) of all meat eaten in the UK is processed. This is particularly concerning for children, for whom processed meat makes up over a third (36%) of their meat intake.
*   **Demographic Disparities:**
    *   **Age:** Younger adults (19-40) eat the largest amount of meat overall, driven by high white meat consumption. Young men (19-40) eat the largest amount of processed meat of any demographic group.
    *   **Sex:** Men eat significantly more meat than women, particularly processed meat (20% more). Almost a third (31%) of all meat eaten by men is processed.
    *   **Geography:** Citizens in Northern Ireland eat the most meat (108g/day) and the most processed meat (39g/day) of all UK nations.
*   **The Role of Out-of-Home Eating:** Over a quarter (28%) of meat is eaten outside the home. Significantly, over a third (36%) of all processed meat is consumed in the out-of-home sector. Four of the five most common meat dishes from fast-food outlets are processed and/or ultra-processed.

**Sourcing, Farming, and Environmental Impact:**

*   **Reliance on Imports:** The UK is a net importer of beef (31%), pork (51%), and chicken (26%). Just under a third (32%) of red meat imported is processed, risking the undercutting of British farmers with products made to lower environmental and welfare standards.
*   **Environmental Case for Reduction:** Meat consumption accounts for 32% of the UK's diet-related greenhouse gas emissions (GHGEs). The report concludes that improving production practices ("better" meat) is insufficient without reducing overall consumption ("less" meat) to meet climate targets, primarily due to land constraints.
*   **The Problem with Poultry:** While chicken has a lower carbon footprint than red meat, its popularity raises significant concerns regarding animal welfare (less than 4% of UK chicken is free-range), antibiotic use, and the environmental impact of imported soy feed on global deforestation.
*   **Biodiversity Loss:** Current UK dietary patterns, driven largely by ruminant meat consumption, contribute to a global risk of species extinction. The report finds that a shift to plant-based diets could reduce this extinction risk by 58%.

**Health Implications:**

*   **Processed Meat and Health Risks:** The report reiterates that processed meat is classified as a Group 1 carcinogen by the WHO's International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). High consumption is strongly linked to an increased risk of bowel cancer, cardiovascular disease, and dementia.

**Recommendations:**

*   **For Businesses:** Reduce reliance on processed meat, especially in the out-of-home sector; set sales-based targets to increase the ratio of plant-to-animal protein; and make whole plant foods more appealing and affordable.
*   **For Policymakers:** Strengthen public procurement rules to limit processed meat in schools and hospitals; support the UK's horticulture sector to increase the production of fruit, vegetables, and legumes; and introduce mandatory reporting for large food businesses on the health and sustainability of their sales.
