Monaco, A., Kotz, J., Al Masri, M., Allmeta, A., Purnhagen, K. P., & König, L. M. (2024). Consumers’ perception of novel foods and the impact of heuristics and biases: A systematic review. _Appetite_, 107285.

## Abstract

According to the definition adopted in the European Union, <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">novel foods</mark> are foods that were not consumed to a significant degree within the Union before May 15, 1997. This includes cultivated meat and insects. Novel foods are meant to play a critical role in the transition towards sustainable food systems. However, their success depends on whether and to what extent they will be incorporated into the diets at the population level. 

This review investigates consumers’ perception of novel food products by narratively synthesising results on the influence of heuristics and biases triggered by emotions, personality traits, and socio-cultural factors. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Empirical studies conducted in Western countries and published in English after 1997 </mark>were eligible, which led to <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">182 studies</mark> being included. Notably, most included studies focused on insects and cultivated meat. 

<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Disgust and fear are shown to be the main emotions driving rejection of novel foods, together with food neophobia and specific cultural norms common across countries </mark>included in the scope of the review. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Familiarity with novel foods and curiosity both led to higher acceptance</mark>. Despite being investigated directly in a minority of studies, heuristics and related biases mostly fell under the “affect,” the “natural-is-better,” and the “trust” heuristics. The review also discusses to what extent consumers' perception reflects in the regulatory framework applicable to novel foods in the European Union, how it influences the regulation of insects and cultivated meat and which lessons can be drawn for the future of the regulatory framework.
