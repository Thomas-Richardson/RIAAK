Mood, A., & Brooke, P. (2024). Estimating global numbers of fishes caught from the wild annually from 2000 to 2019. _Animal Welfare_, _33_, e6.

Finfishes are caught from the wild for food, feed (often in the form of fishmeal and oil) and bait. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">According to the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO), between 74 and 83 million tonnes (averaging 77 million tonnes) were caught annually in 2000–2019. </mark>Although fishes are now widely recognised as sentient beings, capture is still quantified as biomass rather than number of individuals (in contrast to wild-caught marine mammals and crocodiles; and farmed mammals and birds). Here, we estimate global numbers of wild-caught finfishes using FAO capture production (landing) tonnages (2000–2019 data) and estimates of mean individual weight at capture, based on internet-sourced capture and market weights. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">We estimate that between</mark> 1,100 and 2,200 billion (1.1–2.2 × 1012), or <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">1.1–2.2 trillion, wild finfishes were caught annually, on average, during 2000–2019</mark>. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Anchoveta (Engraulis ringens) comprised 28%,</mark> by estimate midpoint. Estimated numbers in 2019, totalling 980–1,900 billion, were lower due to reduced anchoveta landings, but still <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">represented 87.5% of vertebrate numbers killed for food or feed</mark>, as obtained or estimated from FAO data. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">These figures exclude unrecorded capture such as illegal fishing, discards and ghost fishing</mark>. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Estimated finfish numbers used for reduction to fishmeal and oil represented 56% of the total 2010 estimate</mark> (1,000–1,900 billion), by midpoint. It is recommended that the FAO reports fish capture numbers. The welfare of wild-caught fishes, which is generally very poor during and after capture, should be addressed as part of sustainable utilisation of aquatic resources.
