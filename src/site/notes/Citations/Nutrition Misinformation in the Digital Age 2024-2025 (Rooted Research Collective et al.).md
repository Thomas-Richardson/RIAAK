### Executive summary

Poor nutrition remains a leading preventable risk factor for non-communicable diseases (NCDs), yet the rise of nutrition misinformation on social media complicates public understanding and adherence to evidence-based dietary guidelines. This study aimed to explore the landscape of nutrition misinformation on Instagram by identifying and analysing influential “super-spreaders” who drive misleading dietary narratives. Using social network analysis, 53 key accounts with a combined following exceeding 24 million were categorised into three personas: The Doc, The Rebel and The Hustler. These influencers employ emotional storytelling and exploit claims of authority to promote diets such as keto and carnivore, spread seed oil conspiracies and undermine evidence-based nutrition. Key dissemination strategies identified include fear-mongering, joy-mongering and sprinkling misinformation within broader lifestyle content. 96% of these super-spreaders exhibited clear financial incentives tied to their messaging. The misuse of professional credentials, especially amongst The Doc group, significantly amplifies misinformation's impact. These findings contribute to a growing body of research on health and nutrition misinformation by offering new insight into the narratives and engagement tactics that drive virality.
