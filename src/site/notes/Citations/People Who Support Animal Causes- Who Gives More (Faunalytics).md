This report follows up on a previous Faunalytics study about people who donate to animal causes. It examines which characteristics of animal-cause donors predict who gives the most money, what other support they provide, and under what circumstances.

### Conclusions & Recommendations

*   **Pay attention to what people do, not what they say:** People who claim an animal-related charity is their most important do not necessarily follow through with behaviors like donating money or time.
*   **The biggest financial donors aren’t necessarily wealthy:** While wealthier individuals give larger amounts, people who eat a veg*n diet or engage in hobbies like bird-watching are also likely to make larger financial donations.
*   **Some non-animal charitable interests are cooperative, not competitive:** People who donate to social service, environmental, or political causes are more likely to contribute to animal organizations in non-monetary ways, such as volunteering or activism.
*   **Some financial donation methods might be better than others:** Previous donations via phone calls were associated with larger and recurring donations. Donations via text message were even more strongly associated with setting up recurring donations.
*   **Donation of time/goods is associated with certain methods:** People who donate time or goods often use social media to donate, purchase merchandise, and donate in person.
*   **Activism is associated with additional donation methods:** Activists use social media, but also contribute via a charity’s website, third-party platforms (like Amazon Smile), and spontaneous cash donations.
