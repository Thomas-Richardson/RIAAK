This case study focuses on GoodDot, an Indian alternative protein company. Founded in 2016 by Abhishek Sinha and Deepak Parihar, who were motivated by compassion for animals, the company has become one of India’s largest alternative protein businesses by capital raised (GFI India, 2024), and now sells 65,000 plant-based meat substitutes each day.

Plant-based food advocates see promise in alternative proteins, because they could displace meat sales by offering competitor products made with no animal suffering and less environmental impact. The industry is currently concentrated in Western countries, especially the United States. Introducing alternative proteins to neglected geographies—especially places, such as India, where consumers show great interest in the products—requires developing foods suited to local tastes, and could displace meat sales in the areas where meat consumption is growing at the fastest rates.

It can be difficult for alternative protein companies to ensure their products actually displace meat sales, rather than provide a niche luxury good for vegetarians. GoodDot prices some plant-based substitutes cheaper than meat, which alternative protein advocates widely believe will be necessary to lead to meat displacement, and reports that their products have helped at least 12,000 consumers transition to vegetarianism.

We believe GoodDot offers a useful case study for potential entrepreneurs because they have achieved price parity across a range of products and succeeded in a non-Western market, and for philanthropists and other stakeholders interested in meat reduction because they have attempted to track actual meat displacement. Alternative proteins include _plant-based meat_, like the products GoodDot manufactures from soy and pea, as well as _fermented protein_ (e.g. Quorn) and _cultivated meat_ (a.k.a. clean meat and lab-grown meat). Although this case study focuses on plant-based meat, we hope readers find relevant lessons for other alternative proteins.

This case study has been informed by interviews with Abhishek Sinha, GoodDot’s CEO, as well as public reporting.
