### Introduction

New York City has taken significant steps in advancing plant-based food policies under Mayor Eric Adams and the Mayor’s Office of Food Policy (MOFP), focusing on reducing the city’s environmental impact and addressing public health concerns. These initiatives include the introduction of plant-based meals in public schools, hospitals, and other city agencies. The city’s purchasing power, with an annual food budget of approximately $330 million, has been leveraged to promote healthier and more sustainable eating habits, contributing to a 26% reduction in food-related greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from 2019 to 2022​. In addition to environmental benefits, these policies aim to improve public health by offering more nutritious meal options. For instance, plant-based meals are now the default choice in many public hospitals, and programs like “Plant-Powered Fridays” in schools are part of a broader strategy to encourage plant-forward diets. These efforts are seen as a model for other cities, demonstrating how government-led initiatives can play a role in promoting sustainability and addressing chronic health issues​. This case study showcases the range of levers available to affect plant-based food choices when government bodies decide to make this a priority.

### Conclusion

New York City’s efforts to promote plant-forward food policies under Mayor Eric Adams provide valuable insights into how government initiatives can drive meaningful change in public health and environmental sustainability. By leveraging its substantial purchasing power and implementing targeted strategies, the city has made progress in reducing food-related greenhouse gas emissions and encouraging healthier eating habits. The city’s approach, which includes updating procurement policies, introducing plant-based defaults, and investing in education and training, offers a practical model for other municipalities seeking to achieve similar outcomes.

For philanthropists and advocates, this case study highlights the importance of a comprehensive and phased approach when implementing dietary shifts at scale. The lessons learned in New York City—such as the need for strong leadership, the value of robust training and education programs, and the benefits of setting clear, measurable targets—can be applied in various contexts to support sustainable food system transformations. Additionally, this example underscores the significance of collaboration between public institutions, non-profits, and the private sector to ensure that initiatives are not only implemented but also sustained over time. By adapting these strategies to local conditions, other cities and organizations can build on New York City’s experience to advance their own plant-forward policies effectively.
