## Executive summary
*   **Mortality rates are high in shrimp aquaculture, implying welfare threats are common.**
    *   It is typical for ~50% of shrimp to die before reaching slaughter age.
    *   This equates to around 1.2 billion premature deaths a day on average.
*   **Mortality varies among species; prioritizing interventions should take this into account.**
    *   Because of high pre-slaughter mortality (~81%), *Macrobrachium* shrimp represent a larger share of farmed shrimp than slaughtered shrimp.
    *   Most individual deaths are *P. vannamei*, despite having the lowest mortality rate.
*   **More larvae die than any other life stage, but this does not necessarily mean efforts should focus on them.**
    *   Uncertainty remains about whether larval shrimp are sentient—they are planktonic, so do not make autonomous decisions.
    *   Minimizing larval deaths could cause compensatory deaths in later life stages (e.g., ensuring weaker larvae survive, who then die from later harsh conditions).
    *   Interventions should likely concentrate on the ongrowing stage (postlarval and juvenile–subadult shrimp), where there are still tens of billions of deaths.
*   **There are several causes of mortality and differences between farm types.**
    *   Most causes are likely a combination of intrinsic shrimp traits (e.g., young shrimp are sensitive to environmental fluctuations), farming practices, and diseases.
    *   Disease is a main cause throughout life, but it is often a downstream effect of issues that farmers have some control over (e.g., poor water quality).
    *   Variation among reported figures, especially that more intensive farms have fewer deaths, suggests many factors are at play and that some are controllable.
*   **The effects of reducing early mortality on industry trajectory are uncertain.**
    *   The number of shrimp born may decrease if farmers must produce fixed output. But shrimp would live longer, increasing the chances for negative experiences.
    *   However, consumer demand has historically outstripped supply, so the industry may grow if it had better control of conditions causing mortality.
    *   If reduced deaths come from intensification of practices, more shrimp may be reared in conditions that can harm welfare (e.g., high stocking densities).
*   **Pre-slaughter mortality cannot depict total welfare because it misses nonfatal effects.**
    *   Mortality is only a *lower*-bound proxy of how many shrimp suffer negative welfare.
    *   Premature mortality is more appropriate as one indicator among many that a welfare reform was successful, rather than an end in itself.
*   **Pre-slaughter mortality data is limited and non-uniform.**
    *   Reports should clarify whether mass die-off events were excluded from mortality estimates and if rates are based on intuition from experience or empirical studies.
