Expected value (EV) maximization is a common method for making decisions across different cause areas. The EV of an action is an average of the possible outcomes of that action, weighted by the probability of those outcomes occurring if the action is performed.
When comparing actions that would benefit different species (e.g., malaria prevention for humans, cage-free campaigns for chickens, stunning operations in shrimp farms), calculating EV includes assessing the probability that the individuals it affects are sentient.
Small invertebrates, like shrimp and insects, have relatively low probabilities of being sentient but are extremely numerous. But because these probabilities aren’t *extremely* low—closer to 0.1 than to 0.000000001—the number of individuals carries enormous weight. As a result, EV maximization tends to favor actions that benefit numerous animals with relatively low probabilities of sentience over actions that benefit larger animals of more certain sentience.
Some people find this conclusion implausible (or even morally abhorrent). How could they resist it?
*Hierarchicalism* is a philosophical view that implies, among other things, that human suffering counts more than equal amounts of nonhuman animal suffering. When we calculate EV, this view tells us to assign extra value to the suffering of humans and other large animals. However, hierarchicalism is difficult to defend: it seems to involve an unmotivated and arbitrary bias in favor of some species over others.
Another option is to reject EV maximization itself. EV maximization has known problems, one of which is that it renders fanatical results; it instructs us to take bets that have an extremely low chance of success as long as the potential payoffs are large enough. We explore alternative decision procedures incorporating *risk aversion*.
There are different ways to be risk averse that have different consequences for interspecies comparisons:
**Aversion to worse-case outcomes** will favor actions to benefit numerous animals with relatively low probabilities of sentience even more strongly than EV maximization.
**Aversion to inefficacy,** a desire that your actions make a positive difference—will favor actions to benefit species of more certain sentience.
**Aversion to acting on ambiguous or uncertain probabilities** will either favor actions to benefit species of more certain sentience or to do more research on invertebrate sentience.
We apply formal models of risk-adjusted expected value to a test comparison among human, chicken, and shrimp interventions.
In a two-way comparison between humans and shrimp, risk-neutral EV and risk aversion about worse-case outcomes heavily favor helping shrimp over humans.
Risk aversion about inefficacy favors helping humans over shrimp.
Chickens (i.e., very numerous animals of likely sentience) are favored over both shrimp and humans on all of EV maximization, worse-case, and difference-making risk aversion.
Our goal here is not to defend a particular attitude toward risk or to recommend any particular practical conclusion. That would require more work. Our main point is that our attitudes about risk can dramatically affect our decisions about how to prioritize human and non-human animal interventions without appealing to often-criticized philosophical assumptions about human superiority.
