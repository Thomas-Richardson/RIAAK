### **Executive summary**

**The public want to reduce meat consumption, but action is stalling**
Awareness of the issues surrounding meat production and consumption is high, as is the willingness to reduce meat intake. Despite this awareness, slow progress is being made on reducing meat consumption. Overall, people want a food system that is good for the environment and animals, but governments across the UK are letting them down. We need a cohesive, joined up food and farming strategy that delivers for animals, people and the planet. Organisations working in the sector can support this by transferring their focus from ‘why', to the ‘how'.

**Despite wanting to, the majority can't access ‘better' meat and dairy products**
Household food insecurity is high, meaning people are unable to afford their typical shop. In accordance with this, the major barrier to buying ‘better' meat and dairy is the price. Finding ways to mainstream ‘less and better' is key, taking the burden off the individual by changing the system. One means of achieving this is through improved public procurement, a commitment made by Labour during their election manifesto to half of all food purchased across the public sector to be locally produced or 'certified to higher environmental standards'. People agree that the public sector can create a market for ‘better' meat and dairy through revised menus in schools and hospitals.

**The public supports our farmers, and believe restoring nature and food production go hand in hand**
Farmers in the UK continue to yield strong support from the British public, particularly those who use ‘better' farming practices. Voters are calling on the government to implement farming policy which provides for both nature and food security, and advocate high standards in trade policy.
