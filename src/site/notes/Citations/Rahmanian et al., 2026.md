Non-soy legumes are rich in protein, fiber, and phytochemicals that may contribute to the prevention and management of obesity. Previous reviews have not specifically evaluated non-soy legumes or comprehensive body composition outcomes, highlighting the need for a focused meta-analysis. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the effects of non-soy legume consumption on body composition parameters in adults, based on evidence from randomized controlled trials. Comprehensive searches were conducted in PubMed, Scopus, Medline, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar up to January 2024 to identify eligible randomized controlled trials assessing the effects of non-soy legumes on body weight, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), and fat mass (FM). Weighted mean differences (WMDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using a random-effects model. Heterogeneity, subgroup analyses, meta-regression, sensitivity analyses, and publication bias were evaluated using standard statistical methods. Thirty-six trials met the inclusion criteria. Non-soy legume consumption significantly reduced WC (WMD: −1.61 cm; 95% CI: −2.06, −1.16; _p_ < 0.001), FM (WMD: −2.00 kg; 95% CI: −2.24, −1.78; _p_ < 0.001), and body weight (WMD: −0.98 kg; 95% CI: −1.63, −0.33; _p_ = 0.003). No significant effect was observed for BMI (WMD: −0.24 kg/m2; 95% CI: −0.50, 0.03; _p_ = 0.08). Subgroup analyses indicated that the effects varied according to intervention duration, participant age, and baseline BMI. Non-soy legume consumption is associated with significant reductions in body weight, waist circumference, and fat mass, but not BMI. These findings support the potential role of non-soy legumes in improving anthropometric measures related to obesity, although further high-quality trials are needed to confirm these effects.
