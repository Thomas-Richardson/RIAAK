# Briefing: Plant-Based Meat and the UK Food System

The government has promised to tackle inflation and increase disposable income by the end of this parliament. However, rising food prices—particularly for meat and dairy—are driving inflation higher than expected. With meat prices rising quickly, **alternative proteins** could play an important role in building a more secure food system.  

This briefing focuses on the **plant-based meat sector**, which offers convenient alternatives to meat within familiar meals (e.g., lasagne made with plant-based mince). The UK has established a reputation as a world leader in this sector, but stalled sales risk undermining that position.

## Why the Government Should Support Plant-Based Meat

- **Food affordability**  
  - In the past year, meat prices have risen faster than plant-based options in every category except bacon.  
  - Some plant-based products are now cheaper than meat equivalents.  
  - Example: a family-sized lasagne with plant-based mince costs **£2.15 less** than one with meat.  

- **Public health**  
  - Replacing **20% of weekly meat consumption** with plant-based options would:  
    - Increase fibre intake by **4%**  
    - Reduce saturated fat intake by **2%**  
    - Without increasing salt or sugar intake  

- **Investment impact**  
  - Public investment has successfully stimulated private investment.  
  - For every **£1 of government funding**, the sector has attracted **£1.92 of private investment**—a stronger return than comparable government investments in **AI** or **university research commercialisation**.  

- **Climate goals**  
  - The Committee on Climate Change recommends replacing **11% of meat with alternatives by 2030** and **20% by 2035**.  
  - Achieving this trajectory would grow retail sales of plant-based meat from **£336m today** to **£2.7bn by 2035**.  

- **Farming opportunities**  
  - Expanding domestic production could benefit UK farmers.  
  - Example: **pea demand could increase by 23%** if more companies source inputs domestically.

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Prioritise alternative proteins** within the Good Food Cycle strategy.  
2. **Develop a horticulture growth plan** to:  
   - Boost domestic production of fruit, vegetables, beans, and pulses.  
   - Expand processing infrastructure for lesser-grown crops.  
   - Link plant-based manufacturers with UK growers.  
3. **Create a £30m innovation fund** to strengthen domestic supply chains and improve taste, affordability, and nutrition of plant-based meat.  
4. **Mandate supermarket reporting** on healthy and sustainable food sales, with targets to:  
   - Increase plant-based protein share.  
   - Boost healthy food sales.  
   - Cut scope 3 supply chain emissions.  
1. **Secure a UK–EU SPS Agreement exemption** to allow the UK to approve new plant-based products with novel ingredients.
