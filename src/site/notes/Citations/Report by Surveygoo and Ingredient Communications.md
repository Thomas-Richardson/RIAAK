Nearly 1,000 consumers were surveyed (499 in the UK and 484 in the US).

75% said manufacturers of vegetarian products should be permitted to use meat-related names like sausage, burger or steak.

58% of respondents said that vegetarian products with meat-related names "describes the nature and format of the product accurately‚Äù

Nearly half of the vegetarians surveyed (49%) said they were more likely to buy a meat-free product if it was labelled with a word such as sausage, burger or steak. 

However, only 19% of vegans said the same, with 57% saying they were less likely to buy a product if it carried a meat-related name.

The respondents were also asked to pick their preferred terms for vegetarian products if meat-related names were banned.
