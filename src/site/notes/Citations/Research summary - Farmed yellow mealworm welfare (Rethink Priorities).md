<ul>
<li>As of 2020, around 300 billion yellow mealworms (<i>Tenebrio molitor</i>) are farmed annually (though recent estimates now put this figure at over 3 trillion individuals ([Pells, 2023](https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-023-00290-z))).</li>
<li>Barrett et al. 2023 is the first publication to consider species-specific welfare concerns for farmed mealworms.</li>
<li>The authors identify 15 current and future welfare concerns, including more pressing current concerns such as:
<ul>
<li>**Disease** — Bacterial, fungal, protist, and viral pathogens can cause sluggishness, tissue damage, slowed growth, increased susceptibility to other diseases, and even mass-mortality events.</li>
<li>**High larval rearing densities** — Density can cause a range of negative effects, including increased cannibalism and disease, higher chances of heat-related death, competition over food leading to malnutrition, and behavioral restriction near pupation.</li>
<li>**Inadequate larval nutrition** — This may result from not providing enough protein in the animals’ largely grains-based diet.</li>
<li>**Light use during handling** — Photophobic adults and larvae may experience significant stress due to light use during handling.</li>
<li>**Slaughter methods** — While we have high empirical uncertainty about the relative harms of slaughter methods, it is clear that some approaches to slaughter and depopulation on farms are more harmful than others.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Future concerns that haven’t yet been realized on farms include:
<ul>
<li>**Novel, potentially toxic, or inadequate feed substrates —** Polymers (like plastics) and mycotoxin-contaminated grains may be more likely to be used in the future.</li>
<li>**Selective breeding and genetic modification** — In vertebrate animals, selective breeding has caused a large number of welfare issues. The same might be expected to become true for mealworms.</li>
</ul>
