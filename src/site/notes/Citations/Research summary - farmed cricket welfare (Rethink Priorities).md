- As of 2020, around 370 to 420 billion crickets and grasshoppers were farmed annually for food and feed, though today the number may be much higher.
    
- Rowe et al. (2024) is the first publication to consider species-specific welfare concerns for several species of crickets on industrialized insect farms.
    
- The authors identify 15 current and 5 future welfare concerns, and make recommendations for reducing the harms from these concerns. These concerns include:
    
    - **Stocking density**
        - High stocking densities can increase the rates of aggression, cannibalism, and behavioral repression among individuals on cricket farms.
    - **Disease**
        - Diseases are relatively common on cricket farms. Common diseases, such as _Acheta domesticus_ densovirus, can cause up to 100% cricket mortality.
    - **Slaughter**
        - Common slaughter methods for crickets on farms include freezing in air, blanching/boiling, and convection baking. Little is known about the relative welfare costs of these methods, and the best ways for a producer to implement a given method.
- Future concerns that haven't yet been realized on farms include:
    
    - **Novel feed substrates**
        - Farmers have explored potentially giving crickets novel feeds, including food waste. This might be nutritionally inadequate or introduce diseases or other issues onto farms.
    - **Selective breeding and genetic modification**
        - In vertebrate animals, selective breeding has caused a large number of welfare issues. The same might be expected to become true for crickets.
