Rethink Priorities conducted a US national poll of 4,446 Americans, adjusted to match a US nationally representative likely voter electorate by weighing on race, age, gender, education, income, socioeconomic status, region, 2016 Presidential vote, and religious attitudes. The raw margin of error is +/-2 points with 95% confidence.

- A significant share of Americans are uncertain (24%-45% don’t know) about their attitudes toward insect farming. This suggests that consumers may be particularly responsive to information on insect farming and that these views are largely “up for grabs”. There may be a large first mover advantage to whomever first ends up informing consumers most clearly.
- More Americans oppose a ballot measure to ban insect feed for farmed animals (49%) than support it (29%)
- We did find high levels of support (52%-65%) for the idea that insects (honeybees, ants, termites) were capable of feeling pain.
