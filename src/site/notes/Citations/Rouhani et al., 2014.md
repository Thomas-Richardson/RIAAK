Rouhani, M. H., Salehi‐Abargouei, A., Surkan, P. J., & Azadbakht, L. J. O. R. (2014). Is there a relationship between red or processed meat intake and obesity? A systematic review and meta‐analysis of observational studies. _Obesity Reviews_, _15_(9), 740-748.

A body of literature exists regarding the association of red and processed meats with obesity; however, the nature and extent of this relation has not been clearly established. The aim of this study is to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the relationship between red and processed meat intake and obesity. We searched multiple electronic databases for observational studies on the relationship between red and processed meat intake and obesity <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">published until July 2013</mark>. Odds ratios (ORs) and means for obesity-related indices and for variables that may contribute to heterogeneity were calculated. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">A systematic review</mark> and <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">a meta-analysis</mark> were conducted with <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">21</mark> and <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">18 studies</mark>, respectively (_n_ = 1,135,661). 

The meta-analysis (_n_ = 113,477) showed that <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">consumption of higher quantities of red and processed meats was a risk factor for obesity (OR: 1.37; 95% CI: 1.14–1.64).</mark> Pooled mean body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC) trends showed that in comparison to those in the lowest ntile, subjects in the highest ntile of red and processed meat consumption had higher BMI (mean difference: 1.37; 95% CI: 0.90–1.84 for red meat; mean difference: 1.32; 95% CI: 0.64–2.00 for processed meat) and WC (mean difference: 2.79; 95% CI: 1.86–3.70 for red meat; mean difference: 2.77; 95% CI: 1.87–2.66 for processed meat). The current analysis revealed that red and processed meat intake is directly associated with risk of obesity, and higher BMI and WC. However, the heterogeneity among studies is significant. These findings suggest a decrease in red and processed meat intake.

## Notes
The effect sizes from this study compare highest to lowest groups of red meat eaters. This is different to most meta analyses that typically report the effect per 50g eaten.highest to lowest consumption changes from study to study so it's unclear what's actually being compared here. This study basically only tells us the difference in risk between people who vaguely "eat a lot of meat" vs people who don't!
