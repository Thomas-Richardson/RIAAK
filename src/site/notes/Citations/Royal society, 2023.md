UK-wide
modelling conducted by the UK Centre for
Ecology and Hydrology to inform the Climate
Change Committee’s Sixth Carbon Budget
estimated that, to meet carbon targets while
maintaining food production, between 7% and
16% of UK land would need to be released
from agriculture by 2035 and used instead
for emissions reductions and carbon storage
(8 – 22% in England, 9% in Scotland, 5 – 7%
in Wales and 8 – 17% in Northern Ireland)45
. In
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, the shift
would mainly be from pasture to forestry and,
to a lesser extent, bioenergy with peatland
restoration (including currently afforested
areas). In England, the biggest shift would
also be from pasture to other uses (forestry,
bioenergy and housing and infrastructure),
but a significant amount of arable land (13%)
would also be released. The National Food
Strategy estimated that 5 – 8% of English land
would need to be released from agriculture
entirely by 2035 to meet climate and
biodiversity targets (pointing out that, as the
least productive 20% of farmland produces
3% of calories, there was considerable
scope to do so without severely impacting
food production).
