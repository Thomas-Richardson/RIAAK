Scarborough, P., Appleby, P. N., Mizdrak, A., Briggs, A. D., Travis, R. C., Bradbury, K. E., & Key, T. J. (2014). Dietary greenhouse gas emissions of meat-eaters, fish-eaters, vegetarians and vegans in the UK. _Climatic change_, _125_(2), 179-192.

The production of animal-based foods is associated with higher greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions than plant-based foods. The objective of this study was to <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">estimate the difference in dietary GHG emissions between self-selected meat-eaters, fish-eaters, vegetarians and vegans in the UK</mark>. Subjects were participants in the EPIC-Oxford cohort study. The diets of <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">2,041 vegans, 15,751 vegetarians, 8,123 fish-eaters and 29,589 meat-eaters</mark> aged 20–79 were assessed using a validated food frequency questionnaire. Comparable GHG emissions parameters were developed for the underlying food codes using a dataset of GHG emissions for 94 food commodities in the UK, with a weighting for the global warming potential of each component gas. The average GHG emissions associated with a standard 2,000 kcal diet were estimated for all subjects. ANOVA was used to estimate average dietary GHG emissions by diet group adjusted for sex and age. The age-and-sex-adjusted mean (95 % confidence interval) GHG emissions in kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalents per day (kgCO2e/day) were: 
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">7.19 (7.16, 7.22) for high meat-eaters ( > = 100 g/d)</mark>
- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">5.63 (5.61, 5.65) for medium meat-eaters (50-99 g/d)</mark>
-  <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">4.67 (4.65, 4.70) for low meat-eaters ( under 50 g/d)  </mark> 
-  <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">3.91 (3.88, 3.94) for fish-eaters</mark> 
-  <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">3.81 (3.79, 3.83) for vegetarians</mark>
-  <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">2.89 (2.83, 2.94) for vegans.</mark>
In conclusion, dietary GHG emissions in self-selected meat-eaters are approximately twice as high as those in vegans. It is likely that reductions in meat consumption would lead to reductions in dietary GHG emissions.
