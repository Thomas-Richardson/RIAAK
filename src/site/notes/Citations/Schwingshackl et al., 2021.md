- We conducted a scoping review of systematic reviews (SRs) on dietary fat intake and health outcomes in human adults within the context of a position paper by the “International Union of Nutritional Sciences Task force on Dietary Fat Quality” tasked to summarize the available evidence and provide dietary recommendations. 
- We systematically searched several databases for relevant SRs of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and/or prospective cohort studies published <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">between 2015 and 2019</mark> assessing the association between dietary fat and health outcomes. 
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Fifty-nine SRs were included.</mark> The findings from SRs of prospective cohort studies, which frequently compare the highest versus lowest intake categories, found <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">mainly no association of total fat, monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA), polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA), and saturated fatty acid (SFA) with risk of chronic diseases. </mark>
- SRs of RCTs applying substitution analyses indicate that SFA replacement with PUFA and/or MUFA improves blood lipids and glycemic control, with the effect of PUFA being more pronounced. 
- A higher intake of total trans-fatty acid (TFA), but not ruminant TFA, was probably associated with an increased risk of mortality and cardiovascular disease based on existing SRs. 
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Overall, the available published evidence deems it reasonable to recommend replacement of SFA with MUFA and PUFA and avoidance of consumption of industrial TFA.</mark>
