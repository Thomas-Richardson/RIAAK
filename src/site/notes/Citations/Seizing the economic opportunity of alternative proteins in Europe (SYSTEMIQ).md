New Systemiq analysis, supported by the Good Food Institute Europe, finds that scaling plant-based foods, cultivated meat, and fermentation-made ingredients could deliver major economic gains for the EU, while improving food security and agricultural resilience.

If treated as a strategic priority, alternative proteins could add **€111 billion a year to the EU economy by 2040**.

### Key findings

With modest investment and supportive policy over the next 15 years, alternative proteins could:

- **Generate €111 billion in annual gross value added**, comparable to Europe’s wine sector.
- **Create a €79 billion domestic market** across the full supply chain—similar to Lithuania’s GDP in 2024.
- **Build a €60 billion export market**, comparable to current EU exports to South Korea, positioning Europe as a global hub for advanced food biomanufacturing.
- **Support 414,000 high-quality jobs** across science, manufacturing, agriculture, and logistics.
