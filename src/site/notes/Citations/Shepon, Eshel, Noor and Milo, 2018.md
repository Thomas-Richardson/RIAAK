- With a third of all food production lost via leaky supply chains or spoilage, food loss is a key contributor to global food insecurity. Demand for resource-intensive animal-based food further limits food availability. 
- In this paper, we show that <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">plant-based replacements for each of the major animal categories</mark> in the United States (beef, pork, dairy, poultry, and eggs) <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">can produce 2 to 20 x more nutritionally similar food per unit cropland</mark>. 
- Replacing all animal-based items with plant-based replacement diets can add enough food to feed 350 million additional people in the US alone, <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">more than the expected benefits of eliminating all supply chain food loss</mark>.

Basically reducing meat is more important than curbing food loss

- Food loss is widely recognized as undermining food security and environmental sustainability. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">However, consumption of resource-intensive food items instead of more efficient, equally nutritious alternatives can also be considered as an effective food loss</mark>. Here we define and quantify these opportunity food losses as the food loss associated with consuming resource-intensive animal-based items instead of plant-based alternatives which are nutritionally comparable, e.g., in terms of protein content. 
- We consider replacements that minimize cropland use for each of the main US animal-based food categories. 
- We find that although the characteristic conventional retail-to-consumer food losses are â‰ˆ30% for plant and animal products, <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">the opportunity food losses of beef, pork, dairy, poultry, and eggs are 96%, 90%, 75%, 50%, and 40%, respectively</mark>. 
- This arises because plant-based replacement diets can produce 20-fold and twofold more nutritionally similar food per cropland than beef and eggs, the most and least resource-intensive animal categories, respectively. 
- Although conventional and opportunity food losses are both targets for improvement, the high opportunity food losses highlight the large potential savings beyond conventionally defined food losses. Concurrently replacing all animal-based items in the US diet with plant-based alternatives will add enough food to feed, in full, 350 million additional people, well above the expected benefits of eliminating all supply chain food waste. These results highlight the importance of dietary shifts to improving food availability and security.
