Simões, M., Janssen, N., Heederik, D. J., Smit, L. A., Vermeulen, R., & Huss, A. (2022). Residential proximity to livestock animals and mortality from respiratory diseases in The Netherlands: A prospective census-based cohort study. _Environment international_, _161_, 107140.

## Abstract

### Background
There is increasing evidence of associations between residential proximity to livestock farms and respiratory morbidity, but less is known about potential effects on respiratory mortality among residents.

### Objectives
We aimed to assess potential associations between respiratory mortality and residential proximity to (intensive) livestock farming.

### Methods
In DUELS, a national census-based cohort, we selected <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">all inhabitants from rural and semi-urban areas of the Netherlands</mark>, aged ≥30 years and living at the same address for five years up to baseline (2004). We followed these <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">∼4 million individuals</mark> for <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">respiratory mortality (respiratory system diseases, chronic lower respiratory diseases, pneumonia) from 2005 to 2012.</mark> We computed the average number of cattle, pigs, chicken, and mink present in 500 m, 1000 m, 1500 m and 2000 m of each individual’s residence in the period 1999–2003. Analyses were conducted using Cox proportional hazards regression, adjusting for potential confounders at individual and neighbourhood level.

### Results
<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">We found evidence that living up to 2000 m of pig farms was associated with respiratory mortality, namely from chronic lower respiratory diseases</mark>, with Hazard Ratios ranging from 1.06 (1.02, 1.10) in people living close to low numbers (<median number of animals) of pigs in 1000 m and 1.18 (1.13, 1.24) in those living near high numbers (≥median) of pigs in 2000 m. We also found indications of higher pneumonia mortality in people living near mink farms.

### Conclusion
Our results are in line with previous findings of adverse respiratory effects in people living near livestock farms. Little is known about the physical, chemical, and biological exposures leading to respiratory morbidity and mortality warranting further explorations of air contaminants in the vicinity of livestock farms.

## Notes
There were 2,203,650 (54.5%), 3,525,961 (87.3%), 3,884,771 (96.1%) and 3,993,150 (98.8%) people exposed to at least on type of animal in the 500, 1000, 1500 and 2000 m buffer, respectively.
