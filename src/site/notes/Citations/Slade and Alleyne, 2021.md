- The role of a slaughterhouse worker (SHW) involves the authorized killing of living beings, yet there is limited understanding of the consequences this behavior has on their well-being. 
- The purpose of this systematic review is to collate and evaluate the current literature on the psychological impact of slaughterhouse employment. 
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Fourteen studies</mark> met the specific a priori inclusion criteria. 
- The findings from this review were demarcated by the focus of studies: (1) the prevalence of mental health disorders, (2) the types of coping mechanisms used, and (3) the link between slaughterhouse employment and crime perpetration. 
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">It was found that SHWs have a higher prevalence rate of mental health issues, in particular depression and anxiety</mark>, in addition to violence-supportive attitudes. Furthermore, the workers employ a variety of both adaptive and maladaptive strategies to cope with the workplace environment and associated stressors. 
- Finally, there is some evidence that slaughterhouse work is associated with increased crime levels. The research reviewed has shown a link between slaughterhouse work and antisocial behavior generally and sexual offending specifically. There was no support for such an association with violent crimes, however. Based on existing research, we suggest future directions for research (i.e., applying more methodological rigor) but highlight key findings for practitioners and policymakers that warrant attention.
