- Eggs are among the most subsidized food products globally
- Wild-caught fisheries also receive tremendous subsidy support, estimated at $35 billion USD worldwide in 2009.

## Types of subsidies
- **Welfare-conditional subsidies**, programs where governments pay farmers to adopt higher animal welfare farming methods, may improve conditions for farmed animals in a cost-effective way Types of welfare-conditional subsidies include a government paying farmers whose welfare standards are better than the legally required minimum; offering grants for farmers to switch to higher-welfare farming methods; or requiring farmers to meet animal welfare guidelines to receive other subsidies
	- Switzerland offers two kinds of subsidies: payments for farmers who allow animals regular outdoor exercise and for farmers who keep animals in higher-welfare housing. Most of Switzerland’s chickens, pigs, and cows benefit from at least one welfare-conditional subsidy. Production of pig meat was 19% lower and chicken meat 27% lower than they would have been without the subsidies, and nationwide consumption of both also decreased.
	- Farmers complain that the subsidies are too small to make high-welfare farming cost-effective.
- Eliminating or reducing subsidies for meat production is another reform that could improve conditions for animals, but its effectiveness depends more on the circumstances
	- In the 1980s, New Zealand eliminated subsidies for animal production. Over the next forty years, fewer sheep were farmed, but more chickens were farmed — nearly 1.5x the number of sheep saved.
	- Similar subsidy changes in Mexico in the 1980s and 1990s reduced beef production by 22%, but beef imports increased and overall beef consumption actually increased by 8%. Pig production decreased by 10%, and pig consumption decreased by only 4%.
- **Eliminating feed crop subsidies**: In theory, this would reduce the profit from farming animals, thus reducing the number of animals farmed. However, research suggests that in the U.S., this may result in *more* chickens, pigs, and cows produced for food.
- **Promoting subsidies for plant-based foods**: Studies has found that incentivizing the growth of fruits, vegetables, and other plant-based alternatives doesn’t actually change consumers’ purchasing decisions.
- **Abolishing fisheries subsidies:** This would theoretically cause fewer fishes to be caught in the short term, but proposed fishery subsidy reforms often explicitly aim to increase fish populations for the purpose of fishing them in the long term.
