Air pollution increases cardiovascular and respiratory-disease risk, and reduces cognitive and physical performance. Food production, especially ofÂ animal products, is a major source of methane and ammonia emissions which contribute to air pollution through the formation of particulate matter and ground-level ozone. Here we show that <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">dietary changes towards more plant-based flexitarian, vegetarian, and vegan diets could lead to meaningful reductions in air pollution with health and economic benefits</mark>. Using systems models, <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">we estimated reductions in premature mortality of 108,000-236,000 (3-6%) globally, including 20,000-44,000 (9-21%) in Europe, 14,000-21,000 (12-18%) in North America, and 49,000-121,000 (4-10%) in Eastern Asia. We also estimated greater productivity, increasing economic output by USD 0.6-1.3 trillion (0.5-1.1%).</mark> Our findings suggest that incentivising dietary changes towards more plant-based diets could be a valuable mitigation strategy for reducing ambient air pollution and the associated health and economic impacts, especially in regions with intensive agriculture and high population density.

The globally averaged exposure to PM2.5 was reduced by 3% for flexitarian diets, 6% for vegetarian diets, and 7% for vegan diets, which correspond to reductions in the anthropogenic fraction of 5%, 7%, and 8%, respectively. The exposure to ozone was reduced by 2%, 3%, and 4% for the same set of diets
