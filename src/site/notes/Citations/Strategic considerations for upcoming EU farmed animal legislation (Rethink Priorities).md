The European Commission is planning to revise and expand the scope of European Union (EU) animal protection policies with new legislative proposals in late 2023, likely followed by another ~12-24 months of negotiations before being passed into law. The effective animal advocacy movement should attempt to have the most impact during the policy formation stage and to prioritise which countries need to be targeted to ensure proposals are not significantly weakened before passing into law. I’ve recently written two reports to contribute to strategic discussions, [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KSCjPlwEj8idIF7LEfJ625saUVv-pacBEYzExp-zxuU/edit?usp=sharing) and [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zZW4ae9Cw7LdsS--m2c81_PZPy9Gye95mtHE2lKt1HA/edit?usp=sharing). The two reports total more than 57,000 words. Below is an overview of the project, the main recommendations, and a summary of the main arguments (or see PDF version [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UBZX5v72f07i_CLTBPRL_VwG0gZlQH8I/view?usp=sharing). For readers unfamiliar with the EU it will help to have first read the [introductory post](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/k7W3nz8ME3uxEcm7E/ways-eu-law-might-matter-for-farmed-animals#What_is_the_European_Union_) in [Rethink Priorities](https://rethinkpriorities.org/)’ EU animal policy series, read Lewis Bollard’s Open Philanthropy newsletters on EU topics ([2020](https://us14.campaign-archive.com/?u=66df320da8400b581cbc1b539&id=9345813301), [2017](https://us14.campaign-archive.com/?u=66df320da8400b581cbc1b539&id=cba67f210d)) or watched these time stamped videos on decision-making structures in the EU ([CNBC 2019](https://youtu.be/9eufLQ3sew0?t=100), [Kurzgesagt 2019](https://youtu.be/h4Uu5eyN6VU?t=180)).
