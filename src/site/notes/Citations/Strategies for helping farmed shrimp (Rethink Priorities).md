### Summary

### Shrimp production: industry numbers, trends, and practices

- Shrimp aquaculture can be bad for animals, humans, and the environment
  - At any given time, shrimp are the most numerous farmed animal (Figure 1)

- **Animals like fish are caught and farmed to feed farmed shrimp, increasing the welfare effects of shrimp farming** 
- **The shrimp farming industry contributes to carbon emissions, antimicrobial resistance, food safety, and human labor and rights issues**
- **Production and consumption are concentrated in a handful of countries**
  - China, Ecuador, Viet Nam, India and Indonesia are top producer countries
  - China is also a top importer, alongside the US, Japan, Spain, and France

- **Demand for shrimp is increasing**
  - As the world population grows, so will shrimp consumption
  - Economic growth also correlates with increased shrimp consumption (Figure 2)

- **To meet demand, the industry is adopting more intensive practices**
  - Intensive farms use higher stocking densities, presenting new welfare threats
  - Because the most intensive farms can be located inland and in greenhouses, farms could open in new countries that are otherwise too cold for aquaculture
- **Vegan or diet-change advocacy on only environmental grounds could harm shrimp welfare in the long term by causing people to shift from eating larger-bodied animals, like cattle, to eating shrimp, increasing the overall number of farmed animals**

### Shrimp advocacy: current state, opportunities, and bottlenecks

- In the past few years, a handful of organizations have worked to reduce shrimp suffering
  - Policy advocacy led to the inclusion of decapod crustaceans in the UK Animal Welfare (Sentience) Act 2022, legally recognizing them as sentient
  - Retailer outreach has gained traction in the UK and Netherlands with several companies becoming increasingly aware of growing public concern for crustacean welfare
    - At least six retailers in the UK and Netherlands have implemented some of the world’s first crustacean welfare policies
    - All of these policies commit to eliminating eyestalk ablation and half also plan to electrically stun all shrimp in their supply chains
  - Groups are working with producers to improve their practices, resulting in several agreements to electrically stun shrimp prior to slaughter, protocols to measure on-farm welfare, and training for farmers to monitor and improve their pond conditions
  - Some welfare standards are now included in certification schemes, with several prohibiting eyestalk ablation
- More progress can be made:
  - Add shrimp welfare provisions, such as banning eyestalk ablation and enforcing humane slaughter, to aquaculture certification schemes (similar to certifying eggs as “free-range”)
  - Encourage more retailers, especially in countries that import a lot of shrimp, to source from higher-welfare farms (similar to movement-wide efforts on cage-free eggs)—for now, this means farms that do not source from eyestalk-ablated broodstock and that humanely slaughter shrimp
  - Advocate for shrimp to be protected under animal welfare legislation—only a handful of countries have any mention of decapod crustaceans in animal welfare protections, and even fewer specifically apply to shrimp
  - Develop alternative foods that taste like shrimp to help reduce demand for farmed shrimp
- **To meaningfully help farmed shrimp, key bottlenecks need to be overcome:**
  - A small scientific evidence base about shrimp’s needs means several questions remain unanswered, like what level of crowding impedes their welfare and what temperatures and enrichments they prefer

- **The biggest constraint to improving farmed shrimp lives right now is funding for the movement.** Supporting shrimp work right now could provide much-needed stability to this nascent work and significantly increase the chances of the movement taking on critical momentum for these animals.

- We believe that supporting shrimp welfare is currently one of the largest opportunities for animal funders to have the greatest marginal impact
- Despite these constraints, many options for helping shrimp remain on the table. **Advocates and funders should apply the precautionary principle and act on existing evidence to help shrimp sooner rather than later.**
