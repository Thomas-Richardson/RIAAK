### Summary of findings

This research explores the impact of framing "animal rights" versus "animal freedom" on public perceptions and attitudes towards animals. Drawing from successful strategies in other social movements, such as the Freedom to Marry and Together For Yes campaigns, our study investigates whether emphasising 'freedom' over 'rights' can shift attitudes more effectively by connecting with shared values.

### Key Findings

*   **Framing Effects:** The condition framing animal issues as 'freedom' resulted in slightly more favourable attitudes towards animals than the 'rights' framing. However, this could be attributed to higher baseline responses.
*   **Perception of Terms:** Although we did not find an effect of framing messages in terms of freedom or rights, qualitative responses indicated a clearer and more positive understanding of 'animal freedom' compared to 'animal rights'. Participants associated 'freedom' with tangible benefits for animals such as natural living conditions and autonomy, whereas 'rights' were seen more abstractly as respect and dignity bestowed by humans.
*   **Trait Influences:** A significant positive correlation was found between Human Supremacy Beliefs and the acceptance of common animal practices, highlighting an ideological barrier to changing attitudes through framing alone.

### Implications

This study underscores the potential of framing strategies in influencing public attitudes towards animals. 'Animal freedom' may resonate more effectively by focusing on shared values of autonomy and welfare. However, simply using 'freedom' instead of 'rights' in short messages may not be sufficient to shift attitudes.
