Nature and biodiversity are critical for both planetary and human health - and yet we are facing a global crisis. Our food system is severely damaging the planet, contributing heavily to both greenhouse gas emissions, nature and biodiversity loss, and exerting pressure on ecosystems in multiple, interlinked ways.

But rethinking what we eat and how we produce food has the potential to mitigate the harm current food systems are having on nature and the environment, as well as unlocking significant benefits for public health and the economy.

This briefing summarises some of the risks posed to food businesses and their investors by nature and biodiversity loss and provides suggestions for investors through corporate stewardship and financing activities.
