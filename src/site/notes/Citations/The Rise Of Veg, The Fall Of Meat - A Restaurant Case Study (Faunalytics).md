In this analysis, Faunalytics digs into the specifics of veg and meat orders from a campus café over the past five years and finds an encouraging upward trend.

### Conclusions

The data, while limited to one restaurant, shows some interesting trends on a granular scale. This analysis seems to align with larger trends and advocacy strategies around North America. We would encourage other restaurants — especially mixed veg and non-veg restaurants — use more veg defaults on their menus. It’s a simple change, doesn’t reduce consumer freedom, and should increase profit margins, as meat is often the most expensive part of a dish. The results from this case study show that having a range of default veg items on a menu could be a key driving factor in the rise of veg orders. These results also demonstrate the importance of the breakfast market. The upward trend of veg orders at the café hasn't yet leveled off, so the ultimate impact of a mostly veg default menu may not yet be known.
