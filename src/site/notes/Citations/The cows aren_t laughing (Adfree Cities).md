This report does not contain an executive summary. Here is a summary of the key points.

This report from Adfree Cities argues that the advertising industry is complicit in perpetuating the harmful practices of factory farming by deliberately deceiving consumers and creating a psychological distance between them and the origins of their food.

### Key Points & Statistics:

*   **Scale of the Problem:** Over three-quarters of the UK's farmed land animals, including 95% of chickens, are confined to factory farms. Over 1 billion chickens are slaughtered annually in the UK.
*   **Environmental Impact:** Animal agriculture is a primary driver of environmental crises. It is the single biggest cause of global deforestation and accounts for 57% of total greenhouse gas emissions from the food system, while providing only 18% of calories.
*   **Central Argument:** Advertising for meat, eggs, and dairy plays a crucial role in maintaining public acceptance of this system by creating a "collective denial" about its inherent animal cruelty, environmental destruction, and public health risks.
*   **Deceptive Tactic 1: Concealment & Nostalgia:** Adverts consistently use idyllic imagery of small-scale farms with happy animals in green pastures (the "pastoral myth") to hide the reality of intensive, indoor, industrial confinement.
*   **Deceptive Tactic 2: Erasing & Objectifying the Animal:** Advertising systematically "erases" the living animal to suppress empathy. This is done by either removing animals from ads entirely or by portraying them as cartoonish, anthropomorphic characters who willingly participate in their own consumption (e.g., dancing chickens, smiling cows).
*   **Deceptive Tactic 3: Humane-washing:** Companies use vague and misleading terms like "happier" or "more room" to suggest high welfare standards, when in reality, the conditions are often only marginally better than the industry minimum and still involve intense suffering.
*   **Deceptive Tactic 4: Greenwashing:** The industry actively misinforms the public about its environmental impact with campaigns claiming "sustainable beef" or "climate-controlled pork," while internal goals show no real intention of reducing overall emissions. For example, Burger King's "reduced methane" burger campaign was found to be highly exaggerated.
*   **Deceptive Tactic 5: False Health Claims:** Marketing campaigns frame meat and dairy as essential for a healthy diet, downplaying links to cardiovascular disease, cancer, and the role of factory farming in driving antimicrobial resistance and pandemic risk.
*   **Industry Power & Lobbying:** The report highlights the immense power of the meat and dairy lobbies, which successfully pressure governments to avoid policies that would encourage reduced meat consumption (such as carbon taxes) and even use public funds (e.g., from the EU) to promote meat.
*   **Illusion of Choice:** The constant and ubiquitous advertising for meat and dairy products normalises their consumption, making it an unquestioned cultural default and undermining consumers' ability to make free and informed choices.

### Recommendations for Action:

The report concludes with a call to action, urging citizens and policymakers to:
1.  **End meat, egg, and dairy advertising**, similar to the ban on tobacco advertising.
2.  **Introduce local ethical and low-carbon advertising policies** to restrict harmful products in public spaces.
3.  **Expose misleading advertising** by submitting complaints to regulators like the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA).
4.  **Create ad-free places** by supporting local campaigns to remove corporate billboards from public spaces.
