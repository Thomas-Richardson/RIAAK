### Summary of our analysis

> People in the UK are eating less pork and beef, although production has still grown.

Meat consumption has fallen over the past 20 years, but this trend hasn't been matched by a fall in production.

Self-reported national data shows that, across the UK, people are eating eight per cent less meat than 20 years ago, despite population growth. However, this picture varies for different meats.

People in the UK are eating less pork and beef, both at the population level and per person, although production has still grown. Lamb consumption has fallen eight times faster than production. Poultry bucks the trend as the only meat people in the UK are eating more of, with production exceeding consumption.

**(Chart Title)** There has been little correlation between UK meat production and consumption over the past 20 years

This data suggests no strong link between how much meat the UK has eaten and how much it has produced over the past two decades. Export opportunities mean production has grown, despite falling domestic demand.
