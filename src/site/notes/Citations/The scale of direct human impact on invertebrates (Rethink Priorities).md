## Summary
* Currently, estimates of the number of invertebrates used or killed by humans are very poor.
* Summing the rigorous estimates that exist, at least 7.2 trillion to 26 trillion invertebrates annually are killed directly by humans, and 18 trillion to 40 trillion are used but not killed annually.
* I outline some of the largest invertebrate industries, and estimate the total number of invertebrates used or killed by humans.
* I donâ€™t look at indirect deaths, such as invertebrates impacted by climate change.
* In total, not including nematodes, I believe between 100 trillion and 10 quadrillion invertebrates are directly killed or used annually by humans.
  * The majority of this impact is caused by the application of agricultural pesticides.
