Here we investigate the impacts of media advocating plant-based diets. Search volume for popular films explains the majority of variance in searches for plant-based food, but is not associated with consumption. For three documentaries, we estimated that a standard deviation increase in searches for each film increases searches for plant-based food by up to 43% in the following week. Our findings can inform approaches for raising awareness of sustainable diets.

**Research question.** Do popular media that advocate plant-based diets measurably shift public interest and food purchasing at the national scale? The authors study the six most popular releases they identified across media types: _Forks Over Knives_ (2011), _Cowspiracy_ (2015), _What the Health_ (2017), _Okja_ (2017), _The Game Changers_ (2018) and _You Are What You Eat_ (2024).

**Design and data.**

1. They ran a systematic search (269 candidates; 28 met criteria for discouraging animal-based foods) and selected the six most popular for primary analysis using a threshold of ≥10% of _Okja_’s peak Google Trends popularity. Films accounted for 75% of eligible media but 95.7% of peak search volume; health-framed content dominated popularity.

2. Outcomes combined national Google Trends time series (Jan 2004–May 2024) for “plant based,” “vegan,” and “vegetarian” (split into _Informative_ vs _Behaviour_ query categories) with US consumption/demand measures: milk and plant-based milk purchases (Nielsen, IRI) and meat demand (USDA-based indices).

3. Analytically, they first show predictive associations and then estimate lagged causal effects using autoregressive distributed-lag models with time-varying confounder control, plus negative controls and sensitivity analyses; the study was preregistered and all code/data are public.

**Key findings.**  
• **Films strongly predict search interest.** Adding the six film time series to models of “plant based” searches raised explanatory power from adjusted R²≈0.14 (seasonality only) to 0.64 overall, and to 0.77 for _Behaviour_ queries (e.g., recipes, restaurants). Results replicated worldwide (adjusted R²≈0.70 overall; 0.82 behaviour). [Nature](https://www.nature.com/natfood/current-issue?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
• **Causal, short-run effects on searches (1-week lag).** A one-standard-deviation increase in searches for three health-focused documentaries increased US searches including “plant based” the following week by **24%** for _What the Health_, **9%** for _The Game Changers_, and **8%** for _You Are What You Eat_. For _Behaviour_ queries specifically, the estimated increases were **43%**, **11%**, and **11%**, respectively. Parallel worldwide effects were **20%**, **18%**, and **6%** overall, and **31%**, **17%**, and **7%** for behaviour. [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40973804/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
• **No clear effects on consumption/demand.** Despite clear lifts in search interest, the authors “generally do not detect” effects on nationwide purchases of milk/plant-based milk, plant-based meat market share, or on beef/pork/chicken demand in the short windows examined; one sensitivity analysis suggested a delayed decline in beef demand after _You Are What You Eat_, but this was not a primary, consistent result. [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40973804/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Interpretation.** Documentary films can be powerful **attention catalysts**: they move people from awareness to _intention-proximal_ behaviours (searching recipes, restaurants), but this did **not** translate into near-term shifts in measured purchases/demand at the national level in the study windows. The authors propose several reasons: national demand metrics reflect upstream supply-chain measures and may react more slowly; conversion from intent to purchase likely needs sustained exposure and enabling environments (price, availability, defaults). [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40973804/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Policy and advocacy implications.** Because initial openness is a prerequisite for dietary change, campaigns might leverage health-framed narratives similar to _What the Health_, _The Game Changers_, and _You Are What You Eat_ to spark interest, then pair media pushes with **policy and institutional changes** (e.g., defaults, procurement, availability) to convert interest into behaviour. The paper situates this alongside recent US municipal initiatives (NYC “Eat A Whole Lot More Plants,” LA County procurement motion).

**Methods and transparency notes.**  
• Weekly/monthly series; lagged models with confounder controls; robustness via negative controls and E-value-style sensitivity. [OSF](https://osf.io/preprints/osf/yh94d?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
