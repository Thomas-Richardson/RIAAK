108 patients at King's College hospital in London were interviewed about the policy of reducing red and processed meat in NHS hospitals

After being told that [[Red and processed meat are bad for you\|Red and processed meat are bad for you]] and that they contribute to climate change

<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">most patients did not consider serving processed red meat</mark> (74%) or unprocessed red meat (66.1%) <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">important to them</mark> choosing the response ‘could take it or leave it’ or ‘not at all important’ (Table [1](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/lim2.87#lim287-tbl-0001 "Link to table")). <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Most patients (77.9%) were neutral or supportive of removing processed red meat from menus to reduce the risk of cancer</mark> (Table [2](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/lim2.87#lim287-tbl-0003 "Link to table")). <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Most patients (67%) were also supportive of removing unprocessed red meat from menus to combat climate change</mark>
