## Context
Basically the Johnson administrations response to the Dimbleby report

"In the UK, international trade has always been an important dimension of our food security, however, successful domestic production is what gives us national resilience in an uncertain world."

"Those countries that are entirely dependent on imports for their food supplies tend to be characterised by less choice and higher prices."

The UK currently produces only 23% of the cucumbers and 15% of the tomatoes supplied domestically. This could be improved through an increase in industrial horticulture, which encompasses highly productive, high tech, controlled environment growing operations including multi-acre glasshouses and vertical farms.

British grown beans and pulses are another great example of low carbon sustainable proteins that contribute to healthy diets, contribute substantially to farming objectives; and are recognised as valuable break crops in arable cropping.

In late 2021, we introduced various temporary visa schemes to address acute shortages of pig butchers, poultry workers and HGV drivers. Work coordinated by the Cabinet Office and led by Sir Dave Lewis in 2021
