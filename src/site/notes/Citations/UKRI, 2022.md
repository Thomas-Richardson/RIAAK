- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">The UKRI Transforming Food Production (TFP) team</mark> and Growing Kent & Medway both recognise the emerging opportunity in the alternative protein sector, and have come together to <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">explore the UK priorities for industry, academia, regulatory bodies and funders.</mark> 
- This was achieved through the development of <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">a focussed workshop</mark> to provide a series of roadmaps for key categories of alternative proteins. 
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">The workshop brought together relevant stakeholder experts to determine the UK capabilities and capacity in the alternative protein sector, and where future investments can be targeted to maximise impact. </mark>
- The workshop objectives were to: 
	- Provide a catalyst to build effective consortia 
	- Identify project concepts for forthcoming competitions
	- Provide a consolidated view of opportunities and barriers in the sector
	- Prioritise Technological, Commercial, Regulatory and Consumer actions required across short- (1-2 yrs.), medium- (2-5 yrs.), long- (5-10 yrs.) and very long- (10 yrs.+) term timescales to realise a competitive UK alternative protein sector. 
- This activity builds upon a previous 'Alternative Proteins Roadmapping Workshop' held on 23rd March 2021, the aim of which was to develop a conversation between the TFP programme, participating funded companies and a selection of stakeholders to create a shared vision and preliminary roadmap for the UK alternative protein sector. A link to the report and roadmap can be found here: (https://www.ukri.org/wp-content/ uploads/2021/08/UKRI-060821-Alternative ProteinsRoadmapSummaryReport.pdf). 
- This latest online workshop, held on 22nd February 2022, brought together 30 attendees, all experts from this specialised sector – including senior managers and technical professionals from both UK SMEs, and large businesses in each of the priority sectors listed below. 
- In addition, leading researchers from Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) and representatives from UKRI, Defra, industry bodies, regulators and policy makers associated with alternative protein food products were invited. The priority sectors for workshop participants were: 
	- Plant proteins – pulses, extracts from other plants, agri-food side streams etc 
	- Fermentation – proteins from fermentation-based systems (based on algae, bacteria, fungi or gas-/ energy-based systems), and cell culture technologies that are primarily developing lab meat products
	- Novel systems – new aquaculture, insect proteins 
- The workshop produced a series of roadmaps, one for each priority sector, with expert insight into the current status of the sector, the size of the opportunity and the barriers, and detailed information on the following aspects: 
	- Technical
	- Commercial
	- Regulatory
	- Consumer insight. 
- The alternative protein sector is evolving rapidly, and this report is a snapshot in time. Some of the key recommendations were shared across the priority sectors, and included:
	- Development of an implementation and action plan to coordinate interdisciplinarity, integrating research into the production, novel processing and the potential for onward product development
	- Provide sustainable sources of funding to explore disruptive research and innovation ideas
	- Strengthen capability in the UK to deliver purposeful technology solutions
	- Assessment of the UK landscape to facilitate early engagement and consortia building with suitable industry and academic partners
	- Develop mechanisms to successfully speed up pioneering innovations through the UK market, including access to finance for scale-up
	- Develop a core team for coordinating and building the UK ecosystem, providing a centralised resource accessible to all UK stakeholders
	- Distribute pump-priming funds for onward discovery science and collaborative R&D.
