### Summary of "Until the Seas Run Dry"

This report argues that the industrial aquaculture industry, rather than alleviating pressure on ocean ecosystems, is a primary driver of their destruction due to its reliance on wild-caught fish for feed.

*   **Central Problem:** Industrial aquaculture is a "wasteful industry" that plunders the oceans by catching vast quantities of wild fish to produce fishmeal and fish oil (FMFO) to feed farmed fish.
*   **Scale of the Industry:** Aquaculture is the fastest-growing food production sector, accounting for roughly half of the world's fish consumption.
*   **Impactful Statistic on Wild Catch:** Almost a fifth of the world's total catch of wild fish is not used for human consumption but is processed into FMFO. Of this, 69% of fishmeal and 75% of fish oil is used to feed farmed fish.
*   **Targeting Keystone Species:** The industry primarily targets small "forage fish" (sardines, anchovies, mackerel), which are a critical link in marine food webs. Their mass removal threatens predators like tuna, sharks, marine mammals, and seabirds.
*   **Undermining Food Security:** The practice poses a significant threat to food security in vulnerable coastal communities, particularly in West Africa and Southeast Asia. An estimated 90% of the fish used in FMFO is food-grade and could be used for direct human consumption.
*   **A Hidden Animal Welfare Crisis:** The report highlights the suffering of the 0.5 to 1 trillion (approximately) forage fish caught each year for feed. It emphasizes that these are sentient beings capable of feeling pain and fear.
*   **Geographies of Destruction:** Key FMFO production hubs are in Peru, Chile, and Southeast Asia (China, Thailand, Vietnam). China is the world's largest aquaculture producer and the biggest consumer and importer of fishmeal, receiving 4/5 of Peru's fishmeal exports.
*   **Lack of Transparency and Flawed Certification:** The report criticizes aquafeed producers for a lack of transparency in their supply chains. It also states that certification schemes like the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) and the Marine Ingredients Organisation (IFFO) are inadequate and create a false sense of sustainability.
*   **Environmental & Social Harms:** Fishmeal production is linked to severe pollution, the destruction of coastal ecosystems, and social conflicts over resources in production regions like Peru and West Africa.

**Key Recommendations:**
The report calls for a fundamental transformation of the aquaculture industry, including:
*   **Aquafeed & Aquaculture Industries:** Phase out the use of wild-caught fish in aquafeed and switch to sustainable alternatives (such as insects and algae). Focus on farming herbivorous species that do not require fish-based feed.
*   **Certification Bodies & Policymakers:** Stop certifying fish caught for non-human consumption and cease supporting aquaculture models that rely on wild-caught fish.
*   **Retailers & Consumers:** Commit to supply-chain transparency and reduce consumption of carnivorous farmed species like salmon and shrimp.
