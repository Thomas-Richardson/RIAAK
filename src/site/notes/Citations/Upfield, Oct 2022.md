Consumers were shown pictures of dairy and dairy alternative products, and asked to indicate whether they thought it was dairy based or an alternative to dairy 

As shown in the graph, consumers were able to correctly identify the dairy products in 74%–93% of cases, and were able to correctly identify the dairy alternatives in 73%–91% of cases, usually with a high degree of certainty. This is clear evidence that consumers generally understand the difference between dairy products and alternatives.
