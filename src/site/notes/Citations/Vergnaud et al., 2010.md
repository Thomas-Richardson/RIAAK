## Notes
The cool things about this study 
- Looks at weight gain over time, which is better than simple correlations (this is called [[What is granger causality\|Granger causality]]).
	- A consequence of this is that it can rule out [[Reverse causation\|Reverse causation]] 
- shows that chicken leads to weight gain (see [[The small body problem\|The small body problem]])
- It controls for total energy intake. What this means is that, even among people who eat the same number of calories per day, those who get more of their calories from meat tend to gain more weight. This rules out a common objection: studies that show meat results in bad health might just be showing that high calorie diets are bad, because meat contains higher calories. This study tackles that problem.

## abstract
**Background:** Meat intake may be related to weight gain because of its high energy and fat content. Some observational studies have shown that meat consumption is positively associated with weight gain, but intervention studies have shown mixed results.

**Objective:** Our objective was to assess the association between consumption of total meat, red meat, poultry, and processed meat and weight gain <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">after 5 y of follow-up</mark>, on average, in the large European population who participated in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition-Physical Activity, Nutrition, Alcohol, Cessation of Smoking, Eating Out of Home and Obesity (EPIC-PANACEA) project.

**Design:** A total of <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">103,455 men and 270,348 women aged 25-70 y were recruited between 1992 and 2000 in 10 European countries.</mark> Diet was assessed at baseline with the use of country-specific validated questionnaires. A dietary calibration study was conducted in a representative subsample of the cohort. Weight and height were measured at baseline and self-reported at follow-up in most centers. Associations between energy from meat (kcal/d) and annual weight change (g/y) were assessed with the use of linear mixed models, <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">controlled for age, sex, total energy intake, physical activity, dietary patterns, and other potential confounders.</mark>

**Results:** <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Total meat consumption was positively associated with weight gain</mark> in men and women, in normal-weight and overweight subjects, and in smokers and nonsmokers. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">With adjustment for estimated energy intake, an increase in meat intake of 250 g/d (eg, one steak at approximately 450 kcal) would lead to a 2-kg higher weight gain after 5 y</mark> (95% CI: 1.5, 2.7 kg). Positive associations were observed for red meat, <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">poultry</mark>, and processed meat.

**Conclusion:** Our results suggest that a decrease in meat consumption may improve weight management.
