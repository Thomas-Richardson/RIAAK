> [!NOTE] TLDR
> The paper argues for a livestock on leftovers approach to UK farming: sketching a system that has no animals fed human edible food

Growing cereal crops to feed animals uses 40% of the UK’s entire arable land area - around 2 million hectares - and consumes half of our annual wheat harvest, the nation’s most important staple crop

Grazing and crops grown for animal feed combined represent 85% of the nation’s total agricultural land footprint - at home and abroad

The report breaks down the % of high opportunity feed, low opportunity cost feed and grass we feed to various animals
- Cow's are fed 79% grass
- Sheep fed 86% grass
- Pigs fed 81% high opportunity cost feed
- poultry fed 89% HOC feed

High opportunity cost feed are crops and soy cake

It would also massively reduce the number of livestock animals, in one model reducing the UK’s headcount of non-poultry livestock from 48m to 13m and eliminating the 187m poultry birds entirely - whilst still providing sufficient animal protein for human health, [here](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.01.329)
