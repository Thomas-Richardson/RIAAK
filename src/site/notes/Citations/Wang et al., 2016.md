meta-analysis of studies up to 2014

## Processed meat
All-cause and <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">cancer mortality was evaluated in five studies with a total of 1,144,264 subjects</mark> and 125 794 total deaths and <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">45,738 cancer deaths</mark>; cardiovascular
mortality was evaluated in six studies involving a total of 1 195 947 subjects and 35 426 events. Each serving per day of processed meat consumption was associated with a 15 % (RR = 1·15, 95 % CI 1·11, 1·19; Fig. 1(a)) higher risk of all-cause mortality, a 15% (RR = 1·15, 95 % CI 1·07, 1·24; Fig. 1(b)) higher risk of cardiovascular mortality and an <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">8 % (RR = 1·08, 95 % CI 1·06, 1·11; Fig. 1(c)) higher risk of cancer mortality</mark>.

## Unprocessed red meat
3 studies, cancer mortality higher (RR = 1·12, 95 % CI 1·07, 1·17; P = 0·001).

## total red meat
An increase of each serving per day of total red meat consumption was associated with a statistically significant increased risk of all-cause mortality (RR = 1·17, 95 % CI
1·14, 1·20; Fig. 3(a)), cardiovascular mortality (RR = 1·19, 95 % CI 1·14, 1·25; Fig. 3(b)) and cancer mortality (RR = 1·12, 95 % CI 1·10, 1·14; Fig. 3(c)).

## Critique
Serving size was not present for all studies, so was assumed to be 50g for processed and 100g for unprocessed
