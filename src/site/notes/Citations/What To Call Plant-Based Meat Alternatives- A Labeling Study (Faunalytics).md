### Background

Over the past few years, describing products as *vegan* has increasingly been considered a bad idea. For example, industry leaders have recommended that companies avoid using “v-words” on their meat-free products.

This perception is based on studies showing that, for instance:

*   Putting meat-free options in a separate “vegetarian” section of your menu reduces sales;
*   The word “vegan” reduces foods’ appeal for more consumers than other common labels like “diet,” “sugar-free,” or “gluten-free”.

The term “plant-based” has been widely adopted as an alternative to “vegan” and “vegetarian”. There are good theoretical reasons for this move: The term focuses on what a product contains rather than what it lacks, and it doesn’t have the baggage associated with veganism. However, not much research has examined the relative merits of the terms “plant-based” and “vegan.”

To our knowledge, Faunalytics’ current project is the first to rigorously compare these terms and others using validated scientific methodology and a nationally representative sample of consumers.

### Project Overview

In this three-phase project, we started off by crowd-sourcing a list of potential terms for meat alternatives. We then narrowed the list of suggestions down to 20 and tested them for appeal with meat consumers. The terms included options like *direct protein, harmless,* and *eco.* We also included *vegan* and *plant-based.* In the third and final phase of this project, a large, nationally representative sample of participants made direct, head-to-head comparisons between the eight best performers from the second phase of the study.

### Key Findings

1.  **The average person preferred the label *vegan* over *plant-based* (and most other options):** Counter to commonly held assumptions, consumers said that a vegan burger sounded better than a plant-based burger in a head-to-head comparison. In fact, only *feel-good* outperformed *vegan* as a label.
2.  **All labels were rated similarly and neutrally on measures of sound and likelihood of purchase.** In a head-to-head comparison, the term *plant-based* rated lower than all other descriptors we tested, including *vegan*. This study suggests that labeling a product simply as *plant-based* may appeal to a smaller segment of consumers than many other options, notably including *vegan*.
3.  ***Feel-good* was the most positively rated term.** The success of this broadly positive label suggests playing up the ability of meat-free eating to make a person feel good. In a domain steeped with health and morality messaging, adding a broader, positivity-based approach may be successful with a large number of people.
4.  **To appeal to men, avoid *vegan* and *plant-based.*** Products targeting men—especially young men—should avoid these standard terms. By contrast, the label *direct protein* showed more promise with men.
5.  **Older adults like *zero cholesterol.*** Although it didn’t perform well across the full sample, *zero cholesterol* held significant appeal for older adults.
6.  **We need a range of strategies to appeal to a range of consumers.** As the findings above suggest, there is no one-size-fits-all approach to labeling. For advocates, this means targeting your messages to specific groups. For marketers, as more companies manufacture animal product alternatives, they can target different niches.
