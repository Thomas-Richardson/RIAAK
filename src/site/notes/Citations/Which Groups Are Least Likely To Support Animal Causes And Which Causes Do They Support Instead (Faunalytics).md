I identified five groups who were less likely to donate to animal charities: men, Black and Asian people, and people aged 25-34 or 65+.

I looked at what other causes each of these groups tend to support, and for three of the demographics, found other causes that they were disproportionately likely to donate to:

*   **Men**: The environment, election campaigns, and the elderly.
*   **Black people**: Victims of crime and abuse, election campaigns, human rights and international development, the elderly, children, and places of worship.
*   **People aged 65+**: Places of worship, and troops or veterans

As well as causes they were disproportionately unlikely to donate to:

*   **Men**: Social services
*   **Black people**: The environment, and police, fire and emergency rescue
*   **People aged 65+**: Victims of crime and abuse, human rights and international development, youth development, the environment, and children

I also found that two cause areas are more popular among non-animal donors as a whole: places of worship, and educational institutions or charities. By comparison, the environment, troops and veterans, and disaster relief were all less popular among donors who didn’t give to animals.
