This research examined the effectiveness of different messages in encouraging support for a ban on factory farming among vegans and vegetarians in the UK. A total of 3,948 participants, recruited through Prolific, were presented with one of 19 messages and asked to rate their likelihood of joining a protest calling for a ban on factory farming. Participants were categorised into two main datasets: the 'base' dataset (2,665 participants highly concerned with animal rights) and the 'middle' dataset (1,283 participants less concerned with animal rights). Additionally, a subset of participants who identified strictly as vegan or vegetarian was analysed separately.

The most effective message overall focused on a 'Future Vision', increasing support by 12.32% relative to the control for the entire dataset and showing similarly strong effects within both the base and middle datasets. This message envisioned a future where animals are seen as individuals who matter, where their similarities to us are embraced, and their differences are celebrated. It painted a picture of a society that moves away from the confinement and suffering of factory farming towards one where farmed animals live freely and thrive as re-wilders in green spaces, or as friends and family members in our homes and communities.

While 'Future Vision' messages had the most consistent positive impact, messages themed around 'Social Movement Resilience,' 'Animal Resistance,' and 'Faith' also demonstrated effectiveness, albeit in a more variable manner.

The findings suggest that while certain messages can increase support for animal freedom efforts, the success of these messages is context-dependent and varies according to participants' pre-existing attitudes and concerns regarding animal rights.

This research highlights the importance of targeted messaging that resonates with specific audience segments to enhance advocacy efforts.
