A first step to targeted pro-vegetarian messaging is identifying who is likely to be receptive to the message. This blog post analyzes a dataset from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) that gives some insight into the demographics of vegetarians in the U.S.

### Key Findings:
*   An estimated 2.2% of the non-incarcerated civilian U.S. population identify as vegetarian.
*   Many self-identified vegetarians are not strictly vegetarian: 48% reported eating red meat, poultry, or fish over a 24-hour period.
*   Self-identified vegetarians are more likely to be female (two-thirds are female).
*   They are more likely to be college-educated (43% had a college degree vs. 27% in the general population).
*   A quarter of self-identified vegetarians report their race/ethnicity as “other” (not White, Black/African American, or Hispanic), compared to just 7% of the general population.
*   70% of self-identified vegetarians were born in the U.S., compared to 86% of the general population.
