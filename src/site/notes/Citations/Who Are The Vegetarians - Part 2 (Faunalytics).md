Many who describe themselves as vegetarian also report eating meat. Non-vegetarians often have “meatless” days. How do these groups compare to “true” vegetarians?

### Summary And Discussion

The following are some key takeaways from this analysis:

*   About half of all self-described “vegetarians” regularly eat meat or fish.
*   There are very few pescetarians, so they can’t account for the many meat-eating “vegetarians”.
*   A large proportion of people have days when they eat neither meat nor fish—an estimated 12.2% of the population ate veggie at least one of the two days for which they were asked to recall their diet.
*   Many more women than men say they are vegetarians, are vegetarians, and have meat-free days.
*   True vegetarians (those who don’t eat meat or fish) overwhelmingly come from educated households and are not Black or Hispanic.
*   People born in Spanish-speaking countries very rarely have meat-free days.
