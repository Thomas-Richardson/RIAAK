A content analysis of articles mentioning veganism published in 2020, the first full year of COVID-19. The results of this study find a mediascape that is vegan curious and generally supportive of plant-based living. Veganism is predominantly presented in a positive light, especially with regard to goods to buy, restaurants to visit and festivals to patronize. Today’s veganism is a more or less normal contender in the marketplace, at least as presented by British newspapers.
- However, the importance of veganism for preventing pandemics (and strengthening resistance to disease) could have been emphasized, but was not. Veganism as a solution to climate change actually surfaced more than veganism as a solution to pandemics.
- Ultimately, the focus on vegan products and dietary practices has created a depoliticized image of veganism. Critical discussions of non-human animal rights and speciesism were noticeably absent in the sample. Approximately half of the articles in the sample related to vegan products or services.
