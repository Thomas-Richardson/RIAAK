## Abstract

A shift from predominantly animal-based to plant-based consumption can benefit both planetary and public health. Nudging may help to promote such a shift. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">This study investigated nudge effects on plant-based alternatives to meat and dairy in an online supermarket.</mark> We conducted a two-arm, parallel-group, randomized controlled real-life online supermarket trial. 

Each customer transaction was randomized to a control arm (regular online supermarket) or an intervention arm (addition of placement, hedonic property and dynamic social norm nudges promoting meat and dairy alternatives). Outcomes were the aggregate of meat and dairy alternative purchases (primary outcome), the number of meat purchases, dairy purchases, meat alternative purchases, and dairy alternative purchases (secondary), and retailer revenue (tertiary). 

Generalized linear mixed models with a Conway–Maxwell Poisson distribution were used to estimate incidence rate ratios (IRRs). Analyzed data included <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">8488 transactions</mark> by participants (n = 4,266 control arm, n = 4,222 intervention arm), out of which 2,411 (66%) were aged above 45 years, 5,660 (67%) were females, and 1,970 (23%) lived in socially disadvantaged neighborhoods. 

- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Intervention arm participants purchased 10% (IRR 1.10 (95% CI 0.99–1.23)) more meat and dairy alternatives 16% (1.16 (0.99–1.36)) more meat alternatives than control arm participants, although these findings are not statistically significant. </mark>
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">There was no difference in dairy alternative purchases (1.00 (0.90–1.10)). </mark>
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Intervention arm participants purchased 3% less meats (0.97 (0.93–1.02)) and 2% less dairy products (0.98 (0.95–1.02)) than control participants. </mark>
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Retailer revenue was not affected (0.98 (0.95–1.01)). </mark>

Online nudging strategies alone did not lead to a statistically significant higher amount of plant-based purchases, but replication of this work is needed with increased study power. Future studies should also consider nudging strategies as part of a broader set of policies to promote plant-based purchases.

## Own notes
Haven't read extensively but seems they had like 8000 participants, yet high numbers of 0s led to low power?! Need to think about this as it could be there's a better way to analyse the data, or it could be that these studies are *really* hard to do, which is worth knowing.
