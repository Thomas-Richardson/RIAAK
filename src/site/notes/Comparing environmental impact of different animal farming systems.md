Deforestation is often more driven by creating grazing land for ruminants than creating cropland to grow animal feed [[Animal agriculture drives deforestation\|Animal agriculture drives deforestation]]

From a ([[Manure from animal agriculture\|manure perspective]]), while pastoralist and small scale systems produce beneficial amounts of manure, factory farms produce far too much for the surrounding environment to handle

From a [[Animal agriculture takes up lots of land but provide few calories\|land use perspective]], CAFOs require too much land to grow their food, while pastoralist system use too much land period

From a water perspective, because CAFOs use more crop feed than grass, they have a much higher water footprint than small scale or pastoral systems. See also ([[Animal agriculture uses lots of water\|Animal agriculture uses lots of water]])
