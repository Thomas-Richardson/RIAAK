- Data for Progress and Farm Forward [conducted](https://www.filesforprogress.org/datasets/2023/8/dfp_farm_forward_humanewashing_tabs.pdf) a survey investigating Americans’ views on their food and the actions of companies that produce it. This survey reveals that a significant portion of Americans are concerned about the accuracy of food marketing, particularly with respect to antibiotic usage in animal products.
- A significant portion of American adults are concerned about where their food comes from (69% “very concerned” or “somewhat concerned”).
- Adults’ top concerns include companies misrepresenting their animal welfare practices (25%), overcharging consumers for products with misleading labels (25%), and engaging in inhumane animal welfare practices (19%)
- A majority of respondents (62%) agree with the claim that grocery stores selling animal products with labels like “antibiotic-free” and Animal Welfare Certified should be subject to regular testing and reporting to ensure products meet the standards they claim they do
- Additionally, the overwhelming majority of adults support mandatory labeling of antibiotic usage (87%), while nearly three-fourths of adults (71%) would lose trust in their grocery store if they discovered that products marketed as raised without antibiotics actually contained antibiotic residues.
- Nearly half of Americans (49%) are skeptical about “humane” or “ethically raised” food labels on animal products, believing they are often misleading about companies’ practices around animal welfare
- After respondents learn more about food labeling in the meat industry, their skepticism around animal product labels increases to 65%.
- After being shown a picture of a chicken farm marketed as Animal Welfare Certified (AWC), half of respondents say the operation either meets their expectations for the AWC label “not very well” (30%) or “not at all” (20%).
