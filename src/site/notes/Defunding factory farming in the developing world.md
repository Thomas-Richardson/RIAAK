#Sinergia_defunding_project 

Whilst divestment is the main term used to describe these tactics, divestment is only one of several related tactics (see below). We will use the umbrella term **defunding campaigns** to avoid confusion, as we believe this captures the bulk of what we mean. 

As cases studies of factory farming defunding campaigns where Sinergia Animal were not involved are largely non-existent, we draw parallels from other social justice movements, such as defunding campaigns for fossil fuels, tobacco, private prisons, and others.
# A broad overview of different financial advocacy tactics to block factory farm financing and expansion

- **Equity/Shareholder divestment campaigns**: This is the most common type of divestment campaign seen, and most of the time when people talk about divestment campaigns more generally, they mean this type of mechanism. The goal of these campaigns is to convince shareholders (particularly large institutional investors like pension funds, university endowments, insurance companies, and asset managers) to sell their shares in a publicly-traded corporation. By doing this, the campaign hopes to increase the cost of capital for that company (see below). Advocates could pressure institutional investors as well as pension funds to sell their shares in large corporations that are building factory farms. 
- **Bond divestment campaigns:** Similar to equity divestment, these campaigns pressure  investors to sell off the corporate bonds they hold in a problematic company.  This has the advantage  of being able to target private companies (i.e. companies not listed on any stock market) which do not have shares and so cannot be targeted with Equity campaigns. 
- **Lender pressure campaigns**: Sometimes, lenders (such as a bank or occasionally governments) choose to limit funding to a company or industry. This is sometimes called **targeted credit rationing**. This is usually because they believe these industries are harmful to society or increasingly risky. Animal advocates could pressure banks and governments to engage in targeted credit rationing of factory farming, such as restricting their lending, withdrawing credit lines, refusing loan applications or not underwriting debt. 
- **Shareholder activism/engagement**: Where shareholders in a publicly traded company exert their shareholder powers to force the company to change its practices. Animal advocates could purchase shares in companies that build factory farms and, in doing so, gain the ability to influence these companies. Mechanisms include voting, filing resolutions, dialogue with the company or lobbying other large shareholders.
- **Government subsidy reform**: Animal advocates could campaign to reduce or eliminate government subsidies for factory farming. 
- **Private Equity and Venture Capital Pressure (PE/VC pressure):** Many agricultural companies, especially newer or expanding ones, may rely on private equity (PE) or venture capital (VC) funding to expand rather than public markets or traditional loans. These funds consist of investor money collected from Limited Partners (LPs), with fund managers (General Partners or GPs) investing this money on their behalf. Animal advocates could target the GPs or the LPs to convince them not to invest in factory farming. 
- Convincing insurers that factory farms are too risky to insure. While this does not have a technical term that we could find, we might call this **insurance denial**. 
- **Supply chain finance disruption**: Many agricultural operations rely on complex supply chain financing mechanisms. Advocates could investigate and target the financiers who provide short-term credit to facilitate these supply chains.

These categories are sometimes combined in the literature. For example, bond divestment and lender pressure campaigns are sometimes collectively referred to as targeting "corporate debt". Additionally, Insurance companies can engage in a kind of shareholder engagement where [they require companies to implement certain policies](https://blogs.edf.org/markets/2025/02/20/insuring-the-transition-underwriting-as-a-tool-on-climate/) as a condition for insuring (or underwriting) them.

This report will primarily address equity divestment campaigns and Lender pressure campaigns. We only briefly discuss insurance denial and private equity, as they are relatively new ideas in defunding activism and as such we could not find a large amount of literature on these topics. We consider subsidy reform and supply chain finance disruption to be strategies worth exploring but ultimately out of scope of the report (though supply chain is mentioned in the case study on the SHAC campaign in the UK). We do not discuss shareholder engagement as it is our understanding that Sinergia is deprioritising this strategy at this time.
# What is the cost of capital and how do campaigns hope to affect it?
A critical concept in defunding campaigns is the cost of capital. The cost of capital as the minimum return a company needs to achieve on its projects to keep its financial backers (investors and lenders) happy. Businesses raise money (by issuing and then selling shares or bonds, or seeking loans) and this is costly. They invest this money into their operations (like building factory farms) hoping to generate more money than the initial cost of raising it. The expected return on investment for a project must be higher than the cost of capital, or that project risks losing the company money. 

The cost of capital for a business is usually measured as the "Weighted Average Cost of Capital" (WACC). It's expressed as a percentage. This percentage is a blend of the interest rate the company pays on its debts (like bank loans or bonds) and the minimum return shareholders expect for the risk of investing their money in the company. The minimum return is not an objective, fixed number, so has to be estimated. The cost of capital for a company can be estimated by academic economists, external investors or industry analysts, or the company themselves.

Activists target the cost of capital in their campaigns because when the cost of capital for a project gets too high, a business may to abandon that project as unprofitable. If the cost of capital for the whole business goes up, the business becomes less profitable, and may struggle to expand or compete in the market. If the cost of capital is high enough, a business may be unable to operate. This is because most large corporations are constantly borrowing new money and refinancing/rolling over old debts. If raising new money becomes significantly _more expensive_ or _difficult_, the company might struggle to pay back older debts as they come due.

The cost of capital is determined by 3 things: 
1. **General Market Conditions:** Things like prevailing interest rates set by central banks. This affect the cost of borrowing for everyone.
2. **Industry specific risk**: the stability of the industry, how risky investors and lenders think it is, and it's reputation with the public and policymakers. Investors working in riskier industries demand higher returns (higher interest on loans, higher expected returns for shares).
3. **Company-Specific Risk:** How risky do lenders and investors think this particular company is? Factors include its financial health, its track record, and its exposure to things like lawsuits, regulations, or protests. 
## An example: Avara Foods
Avara Foods in the UK is choosing where to build a new factory chicken farm. To do this, it chooses to get a loan from a bank. It enters negotiations with several banks, proposing several possible locations for their operation. Because UK demand for UK-grown chicken is high, the potential returns on investment is high. As long as the cost of capital is lower than the return they would make on their poultry, it makes financial sense for them to build the facility. 

If banks see Avara as reliable and well run, and believe there is stable demand for their chicken, they will offer a low interest rate on loans, making it cheap for Avara to borrow money. They will have a low cost of capital. They may borrow a lot of money and expand quickly. On the other hand, the factory farm might inspire protests from activists. Those protests may generate negative press and that might reduce demand for Avara's chicken. Alternatively, perhaps the facility must comply with strict, expensive regulations (such as caps on stocking density). In these cases, the potential return on investment decreases. Furthermore, banks may demand a higher interest rate on the loan if they worry that new regulation may force the facility to shut down. If the return on investment is pushed too low, and/or the cost of capital (here, a loan) gets too high, Avara may choose not to build the factory farm. 

## How campaigns affect the cost of capital
There are 3 ways defunding campaigns can theoretically increase the cost of capital for factory farming corporations:
1. If enough investors sell their shares or bonds in a company, the price decreases. This has no immediate effect on a company, but becomes a problem when a company needs to raise new money. A company must issue more new shares to raise a specific amount of money, or they must promise a higher interest rate on their bonds to convince investors to buy them.
2. If enough lenders refuse to lend to a company, they have less choice of lenders and may be forced to accept worse terms on loans. Worse terms might mean higher interest rates, but could also mean shorter maturities (the loan must be paid back quicker) or more restrictions. 
3. If investors/lenders perceive an industry as risky, they may demand a higher interest rate when loaning that company or buying their bonds.

As we will see, whilst most discussion and scholarship in this area focusses on mechanism 1,  there is little evidence that it works in practice. Fortunately, it is not the only option. Mechanisms 2 and 3 are potentially impactful, but mechanism 2 can be difficult to achieve. Mechanism 3 is the most promising for factory farming but success of these campaigns is hard to measure.


# Scepticism about animal agriculture defunding campaigns: Animal Ask (2022)
This report comes 3 years after [a similar report on divestment tactics](https://c2b5df1e-0ba2-4201-9fb6-87e92e6ad2c0.usrfiles.com/ugd/c2b5df_6218d10c42f64be9873aa89da24e885b.pdf) for the animal advocacy movement was published by the organisation [Animal Ask](https://www.animalask.org/). In brief, the report recommended that the movement deprioritise divestment campaigns as economic studies largely show it fails to increase the cost of capital for the companies it targets. By our analysis, the report is well-researched and summarises the evidence accurately. This raises the question, why write this report?

We believe our report provide unique value over Animal Ask (2022) for a number of reasons: Firstly, the report almost exclusively focussed on what we have called above equity and lender-based defunding campaigns. This report also considers additional targets, such as development finance institutions. As we shall argue, these campaigns are quite different. Secondly, the literature on divestment and defunding has progressed significantly even in the last 3 years, primarily due to an explosion of interest in fossil fuel divestment campaigns. As such, where we discuss similar topics to Animal Ask, we focus on report and academic papers published in the last 3 years. Lastly, we dedicate much more discussion to the indirect benefits of defunding campaigns, such as their potential to stigmatize factory farming and generate unique media attention. 

# Part 1: An effectiveness evaluation of defunding campaign strategies 
# Equity/bond divestment campaigns
We should note that in reviewing this literature, we encountered several methodological issues that. We document these in Appendix A for readers who plan to read the literature themselves.

Furthermore, equity-based divestment campaigns cannot target companies if they are privately owned, as they don't have shares. This is less of an issue for corporate bond based divestment campaigns, but that brings it's own challenges. When private companies issue bonds they are typically bought and sold privately, which makes it difficult to identify campaign targets. Over **half of coal, oil, and gas financing comes from bond issuances** (as opposed to bank loans or equity), highlighting why activists focus on debt markets.

I could only find one study that provided convincing evidence that divestment can work. One study of European Mutual funds (large pooled investment funds) found that when deliberately sell off their biggest holdings in the most carbon-intensive companies, those firms see their stock prices drop by about 3% right away—and by nearly 7 percent over the following two years.  That persistent price decline acts like a higher “cost of capital,” making it more expensive for companies to raise money.  In turn, these firms cut their carbon emissions by roughly 2 percent over four years, while similar companies that weren’t divested actually increased emissions.

[Li and Wang (2023)](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4817129) detail a case study where in 2016 Morningstar released sustainability ratings of a number of investment funds. They compared the performance of companies that were part of low sustainability funds with those that were part of high sustainability funds. The low sustainability companies did see their stock price fall initially, however it recovered back to it's original value within a year. Furthermore, the low sustainability firms did not borrow any less money via bonds or bank loans. The authors interpret this that the cost of capital for these companies must not have changed significantly otherwise they would have reduced borrowing. An alternative explanation is that the cost of capital did go up but that the firms believed that this was temporary and so did not reduce their operations as a result.

[Cojoianu et al., (2020)](https://academic.oup.com/joeg/article/21/1/141/6042790?login=false) find that divestment pledges in a country reduce the funding that goes to fossil fuel companies in that country. The effect was stronger when a country had stronger environmental policies, but weaker in countries with fossil fuel subsidies. This indicates the regulatory environment can strongly influence the effectiveness of campaigns. However, one caveat is that banks in high-divestment countries with the strictest environmental policies often increased their lending to fossil fuel companies in other countries with less regulation

Ultimately, it seems that [Berk and Binsberg (2025)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X24001958) estimate that even if a third of all US investors sold their stocks or bonds in an affected industry, it would barely increase the cost of capital for these firms. They estimated that 85% of wealth in the US would need to be owned by divesting firms before the cost of capital for divested companies would go up. The reason they found this is replaceability; other investors outside the US would buy any divested stocks. Crucially, their calculations would show even smaller effects if we apply it to industries smaller than the fossil fuel industry. And so this means that if we were to apply their model to industrial animal agriculture, we would see even less negligible effects.

[Hanson and Pollin (2020)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00346764.2020.1785539&hl=en&sa=T&oi=gsb&ct=res&cd=0&d=10274914875611987375&ei=1iYSaJXLCbGyieoPkbCKiQE&scisig=AFWwaeYXtc0gIe434OhKbJZ9_1zV) found that none of the 12 divestment announcements they studied had a negative affect on the share price of the fossil fuel industry overall. [Blitz et al., (2020)](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3728025) find that environmentally unsustainable firms do not seem to have any difficulty raising new capital from issuing new stocks on bonds.

Between 2010 and 2019, [oil companies did not have higher bond interest rates](https://www.financite.be/sites/default/files/references/files/1.9.33388081.pdf) than other industrial companies (that are not targeted by divestment, but who are similar companies otherwise). This suggests that their cost of capital has not been rising despite the success of the divestment movement. Interestingly, [one study](https://ideas.repec.org/a/sae/enejou/v43y2022i6p285-308.html) of nearly 2000 US firms between 2012 and 2020 suggests that investors may actually be using divestment announcements to *increase* the profits they get from investing in fossil fuels. When divestment announcements happen, the stock price of fossil fuel companies often goes down, and some investors buy those stocks at this cheaper price, only to sell them when the price rebounds and profit from the exchange.

[This paper](https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/209602?seq=1) showed that divestment had no impact on aparteid South Africa. The main reasons were that companies that divested from SA in fact barely traded with the country at all, so most divesture was symbolic. Moreover, investors dropped SA stock but others simply bought it and pocketed the profit. Similarly, [this paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10551-018-4021-0) shows that a boycott campaign 2001-2012 of 4 large energy companies for supporting the Sudanese government (who engaged in numerous human rights abuses) had no long term effect on their stock prices (the paper abstract bizarrely leaves this out, claiming the campaign was successful, contradicting it's own data). [Blitz and Swinkels (2020)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm%3Fabstract_id%3D3602316&hl=en&sa=T&oi=gsb&ct=res&cd=0&d=15503488593043407297&ei=fe8XaIQVlozqtA-YsrXwDg&scisig=AAZF9b_prwcpjl8zAzFBGSK5pGGf) Found that over the last 20 years, big tobacco companies have not issued new stocks to raise money. As a result, divesting their stock cannot have any negative effects on them. More generally, [Berk and Binsberg (2025)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X24001958) found that when a company got added or excluded from the FTSE USA 4Good ESG Index, then it had no real effect on their stock price positive or negative. 
## Why it doesn't work
The key reasons these campaigns fail is because they are attempting to convince investors to sell their stakes in a company for moral reasons, ignoring how profitable the company may be. In some sense, we are asking investors to forego profits because it is morally right. However, by selling their stake in a company, by selling their stocks or bonds, they are in fact increasing the potential profit that another investor would get from buying them. And so an investor who does not care about our morals will simply buy that stock or bond and take the profit for themselves.

the **global bond market is vast and often less transparent to public scrutiny** than equity holdings. A divestment campaign might convince certain high-profile investors to avoid a company’s bonds, but there may be plenty of other buyers (hedge funds, foreign investors, etc.) willing to buy at the right price. 

Moreover, even if yields rise, the increase might be only a fraction of a percentage point – enough to slightly **raise the cost of capital** but not necessarily enough to force a strategic overhaul.

Also, as [discussed in this study](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/14693062.2023.2261900?needAccess=true). There is the problem of passive investment funds that track indices like Vanguard, Blackrock and State Street. They collectively manage.Over $20 million in assets and 25% of the votes in S&P 500 companies. Many of their funds are essentially pledged to track certain indexes like the S&P 500 or the top 1000 companies in the global economy and as such, it would be extremely difficult for them to divest as they would have to essentially destroy the fund and start a new one, moving all of their investors over.This seems wildly impractical and suggests that it is going to be extremely difficult to convince these funds to divest, And they may even resist the efforts of other shareholders. ==Dicsuss this with o3 could be totally wrong== ost passive asset managers make their
money through fees rather than through investment performance and thus are ultimately motivated to expand
their base of assets under management (and thus, their fees), rather than to improve the underlying economic

# Lender pressure campaigns
There are in fact 2 main types of lender:
1. Commercial banks
2. Development Finance Institutions

Appealing because: it capitalizes on the persistent nature of bank-firm relationships and the non-transferable nature of banks’ private information
# Commercial banks
Major global commercial banks, particularly those headquartered in the United States, France, the United Kingdom, Japan, and the Netherlands, are the primary creditors for the world's largest meat and dairy corporations. [Leading financiers identified](https://feedbackglobal.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/FeedbackReport-ButcheringPlanet-Jul20-HighRes.pdf) include BNP Paribas, Barclays, JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America, HSBC, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial, and Rabobank. In many LMICs, state-owned or state-influenced banks also play a prominent role; In Brazil the state-influenced Banco do Brasil is a key channel for the massive [Plano Safra agricultural credit program](https://www.ukpact.co.uk/case-studies/making-brazil-agri-finance-greener). The national development bank, BNDES, has been a significant investor in major meatpackers [like JBS and Marfrig](https://feedbackglobal.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/FeedbackReport-ButcheringPlanet-Jul20-HighRes.pdf).

Given that many banks may not be able to reach their climate goals without dropping animal ag, and they represent a small amount of their loans, they might cave to pressure [[Mikhail et al., 2024\|Mikhail et al., 2024]]

Some smaller banks are specialised; banks that specialise in agri may not be deterred. they are loathe to ditch their preferred industry

Probably doesn't work; other banks step in. One key study is Sachdeva et al., (2023). They studied "Operation Choke Point" a major initiative led by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), which compelled a subset of banks to limit relationships with firms in certain industries that operated legally but that were believed to pose a high risk for fraud and money laundering—including ammunition, firearms, tobacco, dating and escort services, pornography, and online gambling. [This study](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0308518X221147299) suggests that whilst the divestment campaign for the Dakota access pipeline appeared effective in getting banks to drop loans, other banks filled the gap and the pipeline got built. Energy Transfer Partners (ETP) lost "significant sums, possibly in the billions, due to federally imposed delays prompted by activism."

Similarly [Li and Wang (2023)](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4817129) described above found that after firms were named as being part of a "low sustainability fund", their access to loans did not actually decrease. [Rickmen et al., 2024](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-51662-6) showed using high quality Bloomberg data that there has been no significant reduction in lending to Fossils since Paris agreement: Europe has lent less, but japan and Canadian banks have just stepped in. After the Paris agreement in 2015, banks only slightly increased their interest rates on fossil fuel loans [(Delis et al., 2018)](https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/153560/1/SSRN-id3125017.pdf). In part, this may be due to the fact that incumbant banks feel competitive pressure from emerging banking giants in Asia and Lat Am and so cannot increase interest rates as much as they'd like. [Modelling work](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-51662-6.pdf) shows that getting banks to restrict lending to profitable industries can be very hard without government intervention.

A study of 486 coal companies across the world (75% of coal production) found when banks stop lending to the coal industry (i.e. making new loans and refinanncing old ones) coal companies shrink and decommission their power-plants ([Green and Vallé, 2024)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://www.paris-december.eu/sites/default/files/papers/2024/5291_bvallee%40hbs.edu_2024_complete.pdf&hl=en&sa=T&oi=gsb-ggp&ct=res&cd=0&d=14625656539795122878&ei=Ub0CaKKPM5WrieoPhIm8kQM&scisig=AFWwaeYiFRMivXPJKIZSRXf6qPWJ) However, this may not apply to factory farming; coal is particularly perceived as a dirty industry in decline, even compared to other fossil fuels. Moreoever, banks can substitute lending to other fossil fuel projects, or renewables, making the change easier.

Private Banks don't legally have to announce loans and so you may get a loan cancelled only for another organisation to silently step in and fund it.

# Development Finance Institutions
Development Finance Institutions (DFIs) invest in private sector businesses, banks and projects in less economically developed countries to bring about positive economic, social and environmental change. They’re publicly owned organisations, and a significant number of developed countries, including all the G7, own DFIs. There are also DFIs that are owned by several countries, often called Mutlilateral development Banks, such as the World Bank’s International Finance Corporation (IFC).

DFIs are a considerable source of funding for projects worldwide, with multilateral development banks making up [almost a fifth](https://cdn.gihub.org/umbraco/media/4811/the-role-of-mdbs-in-private-investment-in-iinfrastructure-updated.pdf) of private investment into infrastructure projects in low and middle income countries. THis number is rising rapidly, with MDB investment in Asian infrastructure jumping from almost 0% in 2010 to 5% in 2021. 

Similarly, DFIs are a significant investors in industrial animal agriculture. [World Animal Protection](https://www.worldanimalprotection.org/globalassets/pdfs/reports/english/closing-the-financing-gap.pdf) found that in 2021, whilst 83% of multilateral development banks supported sustainable farming projects, as many as half of them supported a project that could be defined as factory farming. Similarly, A report by the [Bank Information Center](https://bankinformationcenter.org/en-us/update/is-ifcs-livestock-financing-reducing-poverty-food-/) found that the International Finance Corporation (IFC) tripled their funding for industrial livestock over the period 2017 and 2023, providing $1.19 billion in funding between 2020 and 2023. 

Unlike commercial banks, we believe there is significant opportunity for impact in pressure campaigns targeting DFIs to defund industrial animal agriculture.

## The Stop Financing Factory Farming report
- As the report above details from Stop Financing Factory Farming, one difficulty with targeting multilateral development banks is that they don't always announce the projects until they're approved, making them harder to fight.
- As about half of the projects found in the stop financing factory farming work were grants to governments, that suggests that these projects may be particularly influential in informing government policy. On the other hand, it may simply be that they are just symptoms of government policy

## Why are campaigns targeting DFI's likely to be more effective than campaigns against commercial banks?
DFIs operate under public benefit mandates rather than pure profit motives, potentially making them more responsive to ethical and environmental concerns than commercial banks. This characteristic provides advocacy groups with unique leverage points not available when targeting purely commercial entities.

- [The campaign](We will use the term defunding campaigns to avoid confusion. ) to resist the building of a the Agua Zarca Dam in Honduras between 2006 and 2013 led by Berta Cáceres showed success; the International Finance Corporation, Dutch development bank FMO and FinnFund all pulled funding due to the human rights abuses and the murder of Berta, and since then the project has reported failed to secure new funding.

The World Bank lends to middle-income countries at interest rates lower than those offered by commercial banks and provides interest-free loans to the poorest developing nations. References one to four.
The World Bank, through its International Development Association, IDA, offers concessional terms featuring low or no interest rates, extended repayment periods stretching as long as 40 years, even for countries at risk of debt distress. The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development is another arm of the World Bank that lends to middle-income countries at rates below commercial rates.

The FAIR project, making industrial livestock seem like risky investments, can combine with the pressure campaigns on multilateral development banks. Because the multilateral development banks will often crowd in investors, commercial investors. If we can stop them from doing that, we stop them from basically allaying the fears of commercial banks. So not only are we stoking the fears, but we are removing institutions that would normally have kind of eased those fears as well
### Less replaceable
As detailed above, targeting commercial banks in defunding campaigns is unlikely to be successful as other commercial banks will step in and fill cancelled loans. Is it the same for DFIs?  This is due to the fact that most DFIs [operate under the condition of "additionality".](https://ieg.worldbankgroup.org/evaluations/international-finance-corporation-additionality-middle-income-countries/overview-0) Additionality is a guiding principle that states DFIs should aim to make investments only where they can provide unique benefit over and above what commerical investment would bring. 

Additionality can take several forms, including providing more favorable loans with lower interest rates, and extended repayment periods as long as 25 to 40 years (they provide "patient capital"). 

The concept of additionality is a powerful justification for targeting DFIs with defunding campaigns. By definition, Additionality means that DFI loans are unlikely to be replaceable with commercial loans. The IFC explicitly has 

The unique role of MDBs in providing concessional financing and risk mitigation, often for projects with significant development impact but potentially lower commercial returns, suggests that a simple substitution by commercial banks is unlikely.

[A study of 579 IFC projects](https://ieg.worldbankgroup.org/evaluations/international-finance-corporation-additionality-middle-income-countries/overview-0) evaluated between 2011 and 2022 found that 96% of projects achieved some additionality; that is, evidence suggested that the loan would probably not have happened through the private markets without the IFC's help. 82% of projects were set up to have both financial and no-financial additionality, with 60% acheiving this goal, indicating that many DFIs loans can a variety of benefits above and beyond the monetary value. This means that preventing them can be especially high leverage.

Private banks may not step in to fill gaps because they have different risk tolerance and profit requirements. Public development banks will take on projects that private banks wouldn't so by definition some cancelled projects won't be picked up

## Non-financial additionality
Additionality can also be non-financial, including the provision of expertise, technical assistance, risk mitigation through guarantees, and in "standard setting" around environmental and social standards. Standard setting is particularly of interest; this is where the DFI makes the loan on the requirement that the project meets certain ESG standards, often higher standards than would have been required by a commercial bank. This could represent another mechanism to reduce the most problematic livestock practices. If DFIs can be convinced to only make loans at high ESG standards, they can shape the market away from factory farming and towards more ethical, sustainable forms of animal agriculture. 
## Crowding in
DFIs do not only provide direct finance to industrial animal agriculture; they also "crowd in" other lenders. In public infrastructure, multilateral development banks can crowd in as much as [3-5 times](https://cdn.gihub.org/umbraco/media/4811/the-role-of-mdbs-in-private-investment-in-iinfrastructure-updated.pdf) the money they put in. For example, in 2023, development bank investments supporting animal agriculture were doubled by funds from other financial institutions. Moreover, many [DFI's assign favorable risk ratings to industrial animal agriculture](https://stopfinancingfactoryfarming.com/app/uploads/2024/10/eng-white-paper-a4-imprimible.pdf), which sends a concrete signal to commercial banks that investment is safe. The fact that DFIs typically have AAA credit ratings also further de-risks investments in the eyes of commercial banks.

One tactic DFI's use is [Blended Finance](https://www.convergence.finance/api/file/ca94eafee0dd20dc9a5a92e9ca47472d:872a8eee861298ea101425fcc12396204095713bb66344454a078e0435823f2cc4920127c2ed2fd553369685a45cceb493a2d22e0e3e8489bfed1389a9d9e2fae360b2e11c530c1f417a057226e4156395c3223823fc867b98654e6378d3f31b67b655ca2a2b7f868472d5207221d46f6d787d528bd61b3f099e132fd6d63cded0cfa281b73b0f9e2c0ec78273fcaa13). Blended Finance is where a loan is drawn from a mixture of DFI's, government's, philanthropy and commercial lenders. the goal of blended finance is to attract commercial lenders to development projects that they would otherwise find too risky or low-return. For example, DFIs may provide their portion of the loan at very low interest rates in order to allow the commercial lenders to charge higher interest rates and profit more. Or the DFI may guarantee that they will take any initial losses on the loan so commercial investors are not affected. Blended finance has not been as successful as [many development experts would have hoped](https://euideas.eui.eu/2025/05/06/rethinking-private-capital-for-development/), but nonetheless resulted in about [$15B of loans each year](https://www.convergence.finance/resource/state-of-blended-finance-2024/view) to development project for the last decade.

DFI blended finance not only poses a risk of promoting industrial animal agriculture, it also presents a potential solution (see the below section on "offering alternatives to funding factory farming").

# A case study: Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty (SHAC)
[The Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty (SHAC) campaign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_Huntingdon_Animal_Cruelty) was a UK animal rights campaign which had the aim of closing Huntington Life Sciences (HLS), the largest contract animal testing laboratory in Europe. They launched pressure campaigns not against the facility itself, but on any company that worked with them (so-called "secondary and tertiary targetting"). They targetted banks, investors, insurers, caterers, even employees' daycare centres (a description of the tactics can be [found here](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/crimethinc-the-shac-model)). Their campaign was a defunding campaign in the sense that they hoped to pressure enough suppliers and capital to withdraw that HLS would no longer be financially viable. 

Their actions led lead to more than [250 companies](https://www.animalsandsociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/goodman.pdf) abandoning their connections to HLS. The SHAC campaign gained significant momentum bringing the HLS facility close to bankruptcy several times. However, the campaign faltered when [The UK Government directly intervened to protect HLS and oppose the campaign](https://issuu.com/vegfestuk/docs/forca_vegan_magazine_issue_3/s/13782318), The UK Government made unprecedented efforts to support HLS, such as the Bank of England providing HLS with a bank account when commercial banks refused, and arranging government-backed insurance. The campaign was then crushed by the British government, who imprisoned most of the leaders. Activists in the SHAC campaign argue that the government internvetion was driven by a combination of big pharacuetical companies threatening to leave the UK (which would cause severe economic damage to the UK), and biotech billionaire Lord Sainsbury gaining a seat in the House of Lords through a significant political donation. It is possible that if not for these factors the campaign would have successfully closed down the facility. 

The lesson that defunding campaigns can draw from SHAC is not entirely clear. One the one hand, the success in getting suppliers to stop working with HLS, and it's near bankruptcy might indicate that these campaigns are effective. The fact that the campaign did not succeed could be excused by the unique role that Lord Sainsbury played, and the economic vulnerability of the UK economy to pressure from the pharmaceutical industry. On the other hand, it could be a warning that these campaigns may be doomed to failure if their targets are deemed "vital services" by government. If Governments will always step to crush successful defunding campaigns and protect their industries, this suggests that these campaigns are unviable. At the very least, we can conclude that defunding campaigns should give serious consideration to government response should their campaign be successful. The risk may be particularly large in countries with repressive governments and for whom factory farming is seen as a core industry to be supported by the government.

A broader critique of the SHAC campaign is the issue of replacability discussed earlier: even had it been successful in closing down HLS, is is not clear whether that would have led to fewer animals being tested on, as other organisations may have inherited the contracts from HLS' clients and increase their number of animals as a result.

Another insight from the SHAC campaign is that your target often requires suppliers to function, but those suppliers do not necessarily need them, and so are more persuadable. For example; A factory farm cannot operate if large supermarkets will not buy their produce, however those large supermarkets may be able to easily replace a given farm. This means that targeting the supermarket may be an effective lever to damage the factory farm. Applied to defunding campaigns, . Indeed, this logic has been applied to defunding campaigns; [a report](https://foe.org/resources/bull-in-the-climate-shop/) by a coalition of orgs including Friends of the Earth highlights that meat, dairy and feed corporations make up 0.25% of major US bank's lending amounts but represents 11% of the emissions associated with their lending. This may indicate that banks may not be strongly attached to their loans to industrial animal agriculture. 
# Emerging fronts in defunding campaigns: Insurance denial and private equity
Here we briefly touch on 2 emerging fronts in defunding campaigns: Insurance denial and Private Equity.

Insurance denial involves pressuring the insurers of problematic companies to refuse insurance. Many industries that involve manufacturing physical goods are legally required to have insurance of some kind, and so insurance denial has the potential to stop a company in it's tracks, even if the project is profitable and they have the capital to build the project. 

Insurance denial is increasingly discussed in the [Fossil Fuel defunding movement](https://www.ran.org/campaign/insuring-our-future/) (see [also](https://insure-our-future.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IoF-Scorecard-2024.pdf)), though it is early days. Insurance denial campaigns [have succeeded](https://global.insure-our-future.com/probitas-pulls-out-of-eacop-and-west-cumbria-coal-mine/) in blocking the building of a large African oil pipeline and coal mines in the UK and [Australia](https://www.marketforces.org.au/campaigns/stop-adani/theadanilist/#whos-out). One signal that this strategy may be worth exploring is the partial success of this tactic in the SHAC campaign detailed above; the campaign made HLS untouchable by insurance companies. Had the UK government not made the unprecedented step of insuring HSL, the company might have collapsed. Relatedly, Industrial poultry farmers in the UK are reportedly finding it [extremely difficult](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5yvrpl05ejo) to maintain insurance in the face of costly avian flu outbreaks (see also [Farmer's Weekly](https://www.fwi.co.uk/livestock/poultry/avian-influenza-insurance-now-closed-to-new-customers)). We recommend that those seeking to research the feasibility of Insurance Denial for industrial animal agriculture and possible tactics should seek guidance and perhaps even partnership with [Insure Our Future](https://global.insure-our-future.com/campaigns/) as they appear to be thought-leaders on this topic.

It is unclear whether targeting private equity funds is likely to be an effective strategy for defunding industrial animal agriculture. On the one hand, these firms are likely to be an increasingly significant portion of industrial animal agriculture funding in the future. An unfortunate truth is that industrial animal agriculture operations are likely to be very profitable in the short to medium term, which may make them very attractive to private equity firms (though their long-term profitability is debatable). Private equity seems to have no moral issues with [acquiring Fossil Fuel assets](https://pestakeholder.org/news/private-equity-snaps-up-billions-more-in-fossil-fuel-assets/) if they see the potential for short-term profit (See [also](https://www.spglobal.com/market-intelligence/en/news-insights/articles/2024/9/private-equity-moves-into-fossil-fuels-as-genai-drives-energy-demand-83114853)). Given that finance is not always available in lower and middle income countries, this may encourage private equity firms to move in to supply "missing funding". Private equity may also have high replaceability; there is a high risk that any firm pressured to deny funding will be replaced by another PE firm with fewer ethical concerns.

On the other hand, Private equity may be a particularly difficult target. They are often highly secretive in the deals they make, and so it may be difficult to research them. This report by the [Private Equity Stakeholder Project](https://pestakeholder.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/PESP_SpecialReport_ClimateCrisis_Oct2021_Final.pdf) on fossil fuel investment showcases that this research is both difficult but possible. It is also unclear if they are as concerned about their reputation as commercial and development banks. Private equity firms are, more than any other area of finance, seen as exclusively concerned with increasing the efficiency and profitability of companies they acquire. Those who entrust their money to private equity companies may be less persuaded by moral arguments. 



# Part 2: indirect effects of defunding campaigns
# Do defunding campaigns effectively stigmatize factory farming?
Defunding campaigns are not just about causing financial damage to problematic companies and industries. A main goal is to stigmatise the industry and take away its general public acceptance, often called its "social license to operate." An industry's "social license" is the unspoken agreement that lets most businesses act in the world because people, communities, and the government are generally okay with them. Defunding campaigns aim to break down this agreement, stigmatising an industry and resulting in the public and policymakers questioning and resisting them. Many activists argue that revoking the social license to operate is in fact, the primary goal of these campaigns ([Bergman, 2018](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/905d/cc93072a909e938db5935e04368a8fcd875a.pdf)). One example of reduced social license to operate is that 10 UK universities do not allow fossil fuel companies to [advertise at their student job fairs](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2024/dec/20/university-bans-on-big-oil-firms-at-recruitment-fairs-rise-by-30?utm_source=chatgpt.com), and [a survey of 1200 young Americans](https://grist.org/energy/young-people-are-steering-clear-of-oil-jobs-retention-hiring/#:~:text=But%20the%20workforce%20numbers%20have%20been%20on,the%20jobs%20unappealing%2C%20the%20Deloitte%20report%20said.) in 2017 found that 44-62% felt that oil and gas jobs are unappealing, with 2/3 of teenagers in the sample agreeing that the oil and gas industries cause problems rather than solves them. The number of young people training in petroleum engineering has [declined dramatically](https://www.theadvocate.com/acadiana/news/business/article_28912e7e-6812-11eb-b6a6-438eeba0f809.html).
## Do defunding campaigns damage social license to operate?
Unfortunately, there are few solid studies that investigate whether defunding campaigns affect social license to operate. [Ferns et al., (2022)](https://purehost.bath.ac.uk/ws/portalfiles/portal/227211583/AAM_amj.2018.0615.pdf) analysed hundreds of internal and external documents from climate activists, news-media articles, as well as interviewed several activists and finance executives. They found that activists intentionally drew analogies between comparing fossil fuels to big tobacco companies, and comparing their campaign to the fight against South-African apartheid. Over time, they found that others such as churches, celebrities and journalists started to repeat their analogies, making them stick and taking them mainstream. This suggests that the campaigns do influence public discourse. [Bergman (2018)](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/905d/cc93072a909e938db5935e04368a8fcd875a.pdf) coded over 9000 media pieces and found that in the months after high-profile divestment wins, negative moral framing of fossil-fuel firms rose sharply. This result was found even when accounting for general climate news. This suggests that the campaigns themselves were having an effect. However, [[Schwartz et al., 2024\|Schwartz et al., 2024]] found across 3 studies that telling people about divestment announcements didn't shift their attitudes to make them more supportive of a range of climate change measures. This was the only experimental study we could find on the topic. 
## Reframing factory farming
Defunding campaigns have a potential to remove the legitimacy of factory farming farming by taking aim at one of it's primary defences: it's profitability. Similarly to fossil fuels, many who learn about factory farming realise it is a problematic industry. However, they might still tolerate it because it is "good business", "efficient" and profitable. Pension fund managers, investors, DFIs and governments may continue to invest in factory farming, fossil fuels, tobacco or weapons because generating returns and building the economy are their overriding goals, with ethics being a secondary concern. We might call this "the fiduciary excuse", as financial actors excuse themselves of moral responsibility by focussing on their fiduciary duties (the duty to maximise profits for the people who gave you money). This is clearly true in the case of investments in tobacco or weapons companies; investors and funders must know on some level that these companies are harming the world, but the fact that they are profitable investments strongly incentivises downplaying the issue. [Blondeel (2019)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589791819300192?ref=pdf_download&fr=RR-2&rr=946571a87fcb9478) argues that in a capitalist economy, most harms can be ignored if an industry, company or project makes is good business. They argue that a powerful impact of the fossil fuel divestment movement is that it challenges the idea that making a moral choice is "bad for business". In fact, it reframes fossil fuels as risky for business, in addition to bad for the environment and people. Similarly, by positioning factory farming as bad business, defunding campaigns can undermine one of the main arguments it uses to avoid criticism

Additionally, Defunding campaigns allow Animal advocates to reframe factory farming in other damaging ways. For example, they can 
## Response from targeted companies suggests impact
The targets of defunding campaigns are typically extremely dominant industries and global corporations who possess a lot of power. As such, they typically do not need to respond to the demands and arguments of small-scale activist movements. This means that when they do respond to campaigns, it suggests the companies believe there is a real threat to them. This has happened multiple times with fossil fuel divestment; both [Shell](https://www.reuters.com/article/shell-climatechange/shell-says-fossil-fuel-reserves-wontbe-stranded-by-climate-regulation-idUSL6N0O54CB20140519/) and Exxon Mobil felt the need to publicly respond to divestment campaigns. [Ayling (2017)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/am-pdf/10.1111/lapo.12087) documents how in Australia between 2013 and 2016 as more divestment campaigns gained momentum. The Australian coal industry moved from an arrogant "coal is king and everyone loves it" narrative to a "clean coal can be part of the solution to the climate crisis" narrative they also increasingly leaned on the narrative that activists were criminals. The industry moved from being comfortable in it's powerful position, to a defensive position where it felt the need to position divestment activists as criminals to ensure they were seen as "the good guys". 

Animal agriculture takes social license seriously as a threat to their operations. In 2020 Alison Penfold, former Chief executive of the Australian Livestock exporter's council [warned](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-11-14/alison-penfold-says-beef-industry-could-lose-social-licence/12881720) that the Australian beef industry was at risk of losing it's social license. She has since started to provide "social license consultant" services to livestock companies.  The International Finance Corporation at the World Bank recently felt the need to justify it's [investments in industrial livestock](https://www.ifc.org/en/what-we-do/sector-expertise/agribusiness-forestry/supporting-sustainability/sustainable-livestock#accordion-7e410eacae-item-ce3281a8d1). This seems likely to have been caused, or at the very least 
## Are defunding campaigns the best way to stigmatise an industry?
Of course, an industry can be stigmatised through a variety of campaigns, not simply through defunding campaigns. In fact, defunding campaigns may not be the best vehicle by which to stigmatise factory farming. For example, when institutions divest from fossil fuels, [they usually avoid mentioning that fossil fuels are a primary cause of climate change](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/905d/cc93072a909e938db5935e04368a8fcd875a.pdf) as the reason for divestment, instead preferring financial and legal arguments. This does not always happen; when Columbia University in the US divested from private prisons, it cited "the issue of mass incarceration" and "concerned citizens", which is some admission of the issue raised by activists.

[Blondeel (2019)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589791819300192?ref=pdf_download&fr=RR-2&rr=946571a87fcb9478) goes further, arguing that the success of the fossil fuel divestment movement may be due to it taking a moral question and making it a purely financial question. "Is it right to support companies driving the climate crisis?" became "Are fossil fuels a profitable or risky investment?". In short; the movement may have only succeeded by making non-stigmatising arguments. Defunding campaigns cannot stigmatise an industry if they do not publicly state that the industry is harmful, though it is unclear how campaigns can ensure that this happens.

How can we reconcile these findings? We argue that whilst defunding campaigns do not directly stigmatise problematic industries, they do nonetheless damage social licence to operate by removing the fiduciary excuse. Pointing to divestment and defunding does not directly cause stigma, and the stigma must be made with other arguments. Applied to factory farming: undercover investigations exposing unacceptable animal welfare conditions, reports by climate and health scientists on the environmental and health impacts of animal products, and work by investigative journalists on corruption, poor labour practices and collusion in industrial livestock companies. This work stigmatises the industry. Where defunding campaigns play a role, is in ensuring that this work is not brushed aside by those who claim that they have a responsibility to support good business.
# Negative investor perceptions can drive cost of capital
Eroding social license to operate and stigmatising factory farming does not just have indirect, abstract effects. It may also influence the cost of capital for industrial animal agriculture When investors perceive and industry as risky, they demand more from that industry, increasing their cost of capital. Investors demand higher returns from stocks in companies that have environmental concerns such as emissions or pollution ([Chava, 2014](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.2013.1863)). A review by [Wang (2023)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/acfi.13090) of 12 studies finds that companies with higher emissions do face a higher cost of capital. [Wang et al., (2024)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/csr.2853) Found the same result in a large sample of 2,100 Japanese companies. When businesses are vulnerable to climate change, banks charge more interest on loans to them ([Javadi and Masum, 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0929119921001401)). Interestingly, companies also pay higher interest on their loans when their *customers* are vulnerable to climate change. Industrial animal agriculture is of course highly vulnerable to climate change, and as these industries spread in climate vulnerable countries, the customers of these, of industrial animal agriculture, are increasingly climate vulnerable. Highlighting these facts to investors through media reports and dialogue is likely to increase the cost of capital for these companies.

[Füss et al., (2015](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://www.alexandria.unisg.ch/bitstreams/fa5fc949-5f39-47d0-82be-08c1b533230f/download&hl=en&sa=T&oi=gsb-gga&ct=res&cd=0&d=15853973902239572867&ei=QqQHaK6jN5POieoPlcDpoQc&scisig=AFWwaeZ-F3frMlnx4wNHZ26iwHT4)) Found that the interest rates on corporate bonds before, during and after the great financial crisis were driven as much by investor *perceptions* of risk as they were by actual risk. This means that the cost of capital for some companies was higher simply because investors thought of them as more risky, even when they weren't. Interestingly, one study found that when The air around a bank's headquarters becomes more polluted. Those bankers  offer higher interest rates to polluting companies ([Berger et al., 2024](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4906682)). suggests that direct engagement with lenders may affect their decision making. One study found that Investors believe that companies with higher carbon emissions are more likely to default on their loans and that this belief has become stronger since the Paris agreement ([Capasso et al., 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0959652620316814)). Obviously the true risk that these companies face did not change because of the Paris Agreement. It was only investors' perceptions of the riskiness that changed.

This study tested which messages influence how investors (335 participants) see risky investments. It found that highlighting a short-term cost but long-term reward made investors slightly more likely (about 4 percentage points) to change their investment decisions. Other approaches—such as mentioning what most investors do (social norms) or quoting an expert—did not work. Thus, to persuade investors that factory farming is financially risky, messages should emphasize short-term risks or costs combined clearly with long-term benefits.

Use these for stranded asset risk: The Netherlands [has introduced](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/dec/15/netherlands-announces-25bn-plan-to-radically-reduce-livestock-numbers) a €25bn plan to reduce livestock numbers by around a third, and the Committee on Climate Change [clearly state](https://www.theccc.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/The-Sixth-Carbon-Budget-The-UKs-path-to-Net-Zero.pdf) that all routes to the UK reaching net zero require 20-50% reductions in meat consumption, calling it “particularly important”.
## Negative investor perception can be influenced by media attacks
Media exposure can also force companies to address their poor behaviour. Higher measured climate‐risk exposures lead investors to demand a higher cost of equity for those firms. Yet, firms only cut their climate exposures (or emissions) when there’s a surge in media attention on climate—otherwise the elevated cost of capital alone doesn’t prompt them to act ([study](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm%3Fabstract_id%3D4803113&hl=en&sa=T&oi=gsb&ct=res&cd=0&d=4864704470721519881&ei=ktUQaNH3IJPOieoPlcDpoQc&scisig=AFWwaeY8l27Oq30sn1W2xMJ-LhW7)). 

[Becchetti et al., (2023)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1057521923003496) Found that negative media coverage of a company's ESG misconduct increases the returns that investors demand on it's stock, even if the incident occurred up to two years ago. The same results were found by [Hampl and Linnertova (2024)](https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/mf-12-2023-0762/full/html) in a different sample of companies. La Rosa and Bernini (2022) also found the same found the same effect on cost of equity for up to a year after the controversy (they did not measure beyond a year). Additionally, they found that this effect was even stronger in countries where there are higher regulations. This suggests that investors only act on this negative information if they think that regulators are paying attention to it.

[Durand and Vergne (2014)](https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2280) studied 210 companies collectively making up 90% of the arms trade between 1997 and 2007. Crucially, these companies nearly all operated in multiple industries outside of defence and so could liquidate their arms assets if needed (Boeing, for example). They found that each negative article in a major newspaper about one of the targeted firms, increased the probability of them selling off their arms assets by 8%.

In the wake of farmed animal disease outbreaks such as African Swine Fever and HPAI, lenders to factory farms may increase their interest rates, even the farms unaffected by the outbreak. Where algal blooms in rivers cause deaths of marine life, banks may increase their interest rates to factory farms even if they were unlikely to be responsible. Droughts may increase interest rates for ranchers. These effects can be amplified by drawing media attention to the incident. [Correa et al., (2022)](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4161300) found that after natural disasters, US banks increased the interest rates to companies that are more exposed to climate change related risks by an average of 0.19 percentage points (e.g. from 2% to 2.19%). This was true even if those companies weren't directly hit by the disaster, and they saw bigger increases when the disasters go more media attention. 

What is promising about these results is that it indicates Animal Advocates can increase the cost of capital for factory farming as an industry by ensuring there are well-publicised ESG attacks on individual companies and farms.

# Do defunding campaigns generate valuable press opportunities?

To stigmatise industrial animal agriculture, and undermine the social license to operate, it is vital that defunding campaigns receive widespread positive press coverage. Many people do not fully understand what factory farming is, or it's harms. This means that campaigns which raise awareness of factory farming by generating mainstream press can be very valuable. For this reason we examined whether defunding campaigns get favourable press by conducting Google searches and reading all newspaper and reading all news coverage of divestment and defunding campaigns. Our full methods can be found in Appendix 1. A caveat is that current campaigns are quite young, and few campaigns have been run, so we should not expect large amounts of press coverage.

Factory farming defunding campaigns have gained favourable press from mainstream progressive/liberal news outlets such as [The Guardian (UK)](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/mar/18/banks-driving-increase-in-global-meat-and-dairy-production-report-finds) (see also [here](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/apr/07/world-banks-funding-of-hog-hotel-factory-farms-under-fire-over-climate-effect)), [The Independent (UK)](https://www.independent.co.uk/climate-change/news/divestment-farming-councils-climate-change-b1995481.html), and  [Open Democracy](https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/oureconomy/the-worlds-food-systems-are-in-crisis-and-big-agribusiness-is-at-its-heart/), as well as climate publications, such as [Grist](https://grist.org/food-and-agriculture/world-bank-development-banks-factory-farm-climate-industrial-agriculture/) and smaller-scale publications such as [Common Dreams](https://www.commondreams.org/news/development-banks-factory-farming). Kari Hamerschlag from friends of the Earth also secured an opinion piece in the [Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/oct/19/climate-crisis-factory-farming-paris-climate-un) (UK). Whilst this is certainly a strong performance, many of these outlets often report on the problem of factory farming semi-regularly. 

Due to their financial focus, one potentially powerful advantage of these campaigns is to engage media and readers that typically does not report on animal advocacy issues. This includes publications in finance or politically conservative outlets. Encouragingly, there are some signs that they penetrate the world of finance; with favourable coverage in [InvestmentWeek](https://www.investmentweek.co.uk/opinion/4035929/emissions-exxon-meat-target-divestment), [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-12-10/an-investor-presses-his-case-against-industrial-scale-farming), [American Banker](https://www.americanbanker.com/news/activists-to-jpmorgan-chase-bofa-citi-stop-lending-to-factory-farms#:~:text=A%20group%20of%20105%20climate,involved%20with%20large%20factory%20farms), [Responsible Investor](https://www.responsible-investor.com/the-extent-of-investor-myopia-on-the-livestock-sector-is-simply-startling/), and [World Finance](https://www.worldfinance.com/strategy/why-factory-farming-is-no-longer-sustainable). Interestingly, a publication called [Dairy Reporter](https://www.dairyreporter.com/Article/2023/02/17/Rabobank-urged-to-cease-financing-meat-and-dairy-companies-fueling-climate-change/) discussed [Feedback EU's Open letter to Dutch Rabobank](https://www.banktrack.org/download/letter_from_feedback_eu_feedback_global_banktrack_world_animal_protection_to_rabobank_on_industrial_livestock/letter_to_rabobank_26_01.pdf) surprisingly positively. 

Notably, the FAIRR initiative seems to have consistently received positive coverage large financial reporters, such as [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/sustainable-finance-reporting/food-brands-investors-scramble-stave-off-risk-stranded-assets-2024-08-22/) and [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikescott/2019/09/04/could-climate-change-make-cows-the-next-stranded-asset/) , as well as other big outlets such as [Time Magazine](https://time.com/6125014/cows-agricultural-emissions/), to make their claim that livestock companies could have "Stranded Assets" by 2030. See also [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-15/a-private-equity-veteran-wants-to-end-animal-factory-farming)

![Pasted image 20250527202904.png|600](/img/user/Pasted%20image%2020250527202904.png)

There has also been some positive coverage from industries adjacent to finance; [This piece ](https://sigwatch.com/will-big-ag-be-the-next-target-for-activist-divestment-campaigning/)from a business intelligence consultancy argues divestment is a risk agricultural companies should take seriously. Defunding factory farming campaigns have been reported on multiple times in the international development publication DevEx ([here](https://www.devex.com/news/world-bank-doubles-agribusiness-investment-to-9b-in-strategy-shift-108592?oauth_response=success) and [here](https://www.devex.com/news/devex-dish-a-new-vision-for-crops-and-soil-in-guatemala-107728)). They have also been reported in more politically central outlets such as [The Hill ](https://thehill.com/opinion/energy-environment/503130-ways-to-launch-a-factory-farm-divestment-movement/)(USA) and [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/sustainable-business/idb-marfrig-end-talks-200-million-sustainability-loan-2022-02-23/) (Worldwide). That said, we could not find instances of politically conservative news outlets reporting on the campaigns. 

Not all coverage was positive. [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/mar/03/factory-farming-divestment-explain) reported on the factory farm divestment movement in neutral language. However in this case a neutral tone may actually improve the persuasiveness of the article as it avoids coming across as "preachy. The only coverage we could find of the campaigns that could be interpreted as negative was in the UK publication [Pensions Expert](https://www.pensions-expert.com/investment/activists-demand-lgps-divestment-from-factory-farming/54505.article). Their article discussed World Animal Protection's report on UK local government pension funding of factory farming. The piece described divestment pressure as coming from "animal activists" (a term that carries negative connotations in the UK) and featured a quote from a pension fund manager about how divestment isn't always realistic. Even so, it highlighted many key points from the report without pushback.

In conclusion, current factory farming defunding campaigns are quite young, and so have not yet received large volumes of media attention. However, they have secured high profile coverage in some cases. Wherever they are reported, it is usually positive with minimal pushback. There is also evidence that these campaigns may reach outlets that do not typically report on animal advocacy issues such as finance publications. On the other hand, they seem to have not yet realised their promise of reaching politically right-of-centre audiences.

# Do defunding campaigns build capacity?
The success of a campaign is not simply measured in whether it achieves its stated goal, it is also measured by whether it builds a stronger movement to win the next campaign. As such, a vital question is whether defunding campaigns can build capacity for the animal advocacy movement. We consider this from two angles. Firstly, do these campaigns draw in new animal advocates and motivate them to engage in activism. Secondly, we discuss whether defunding campaigns build coalitions with adjacent movements, increasing the power of the movement through pooled resources and pressure.

## Do defunding campaigns draw in and motivate new animal advocates?
There is little doubt that defunding campaigns have built social movements, mobilising hundreds of new volunteers to take the fight to a problematic industry. One major appeal of these campaigns is that they give activists local targets that they have a direct link to; a would-be activist can call on their university to divest from fossil fuels or Israel, or they could call on their pension fund (or the pension fund of their local government) to divest from tobacco or weapons manufacturers. This can make huge, global, far away problems feel personal, with achievable milestones. Interviews with Fossil, Fuel Divestment Activists in [Bergman (2018)](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/905d/cc93072a909e938db5935e04368a8fcd875a.pdf) revealed that the divestment movement revitalised a "sluggish" environmental movement, and got students involved where they hadn't before.  

Divestment campaigns give people a concrete way they personally can make a difference. People feel climate change is too big and too global and long term. A divestment campaign is local, tied directly to the volunteer, concrete and can be achieved in years or sometimes months. Additionally, it shifts the focus from personal sacrifice (such as paying for higher welfare animal products or giving them all together) to targeting institutions. All this makes divestment movements excellent for attracting new activists and building large networks to drive towards your cause.

It is likely that factory farming defunding campaigns would also see these advantages. Citizens in the Global North can fight factory farming by pressuring financial institutions that they have a direct link to, whether those farms are in their local area, or halfway across the world. European commercial banks and pension funds in invest in factory farms and international meat corporations In Brazil and Southeast Asia, giving European citizens a legitimate, personal lever get involved. How else can a young animal lover in Frankfurt, Germany, have any impact on rising industrial chicken farms in Thailand? With Development Finance Institutions the link is slightly less clear. They are funded by the taxes of citizens in a variety of countries, and they are at least somewhat beholden to these citizens (or at least to their governments). However, DFIs may be too remote to galvanise activists; the average European likely does not feel connected to the European Investment Bank, for example.

Additionally, the animal advocacy movement may not need defunding campaigns to build capacity as much as other movements. The impacts of climate change will be felt in decades, but animals are suffering and dying on factory farms right now. As such, we do not strictly need defunding campaigns to make the problem concrete and "real", as a concerned citizen can simply reduce their animal product consumption, go vegetarian or vegan. Additionally, the animal advocacy movement has a variety of local targets for any would-be activist, from convincing institutions to switch catering to plant-based, to shutting down fur farms and animal testing facilities. These are also concrete, achievable goals, perhaps more achievable than convincing an institutions to divest from animal agriculture. 

In sum, historic divestment campaigns have been very successful in galvanising social movements against problematic industries, creating large numbers of activists. This is because they create local targets that people have direct personal connections to (through their investments), and convincing institutions to divest is a concrete, achievable goal. Factory farming defunding campaigns would also have many of these advantages, and so defunding campaigns should be explored as a tool to build capacity for the animal advocacy movement. They may be particularly promising in rallying large amounts of support from across the world against targets in specific locations, such as developing countries, where there are fewer animal advocates. However, the animal advocacy movement has a variety of other campaigns that have similar benefits so we should not expect defunding campaigns to produce a similar explosion in capacity as other social movements have experienced. 

## Do defunding campaigns create strong coalitions with other movements?
Defunding campaigns frequently involve collaboration of multiple organisations and activists groups that may span multiple cause areas. A classic historical example was the [interfaith campaigns](https://www.aamarchives.org/who-was-involved/faith-organisations.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com) that united most major world religions against the South African apartheid. Faith organisations within the catholic church have also . Religious organisations are particularly open to divesting problematic industries, and so defunding campaigns may be a unique way to collaborate with faith-based organisations. Another example that the reader is likely aware of is the [Stop Financing Factory Farming](https://stopfinancingfactoryfarming.com/about/) coalition, of which Sinergia Animal is a member. Crucially, this movement involves organisations such as the Bank Information Center and The International Accountability Project, who are not dedicated animal advocacy organisations.

Coalition building can allow a small movement such as animal advocacy to "punch above it's weight", by sharing resources, knowledge and networks with other organisations. There is a large academic literature documenting how coalitions are more likely to win policy outcomes ([Van Dyke and Amos, 2017](https://sites.ucmerced.edu/files/nvandyke/files/van_dyke_and_amos_-_social_movement_coalitions.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)). They can unite activists who might never normally talk to each other ([Mayer, 2010](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/0893h3md)). One particularly promising way this can pay off is when non-animal organisations publicise these campaigns to their followers, putting pro animal messaging in front of audience that would not normally seek it out. Coalitions from non-animal advocacy organisations can communicate to the general public that the campaign isn't "just a vegan thing", making them more open to their messages. Finally, collaboration with other organisations can counter criticism. For example, when an animal advocacy organisation partners with local labour unions to deny funding to a new factory farm in their area, the latter group directly contradicts industry counter narratives that "animal rights activists are blocking job creation".
# Do defunding campaigns lead to regulation?
Defunding campaigns can exert significant indirect influence by signaling strong public opposition to problematic industries such as factory farming. This public sentiment can, in turn, motivate policymakers to introduce restrictive regulations on that industry. Whether driven by a genuine desire to represent constituents or by political opportunism, the potential for these campaigns to translate into meaningful legislative change underscores their value.

A fundamental problem with any policy work is that it is usually unclear what factors led to a policy being passed. Usually it is a multitude of factors and the efforts of many stakeholders. As such, with defunding campaigns it is no different. It is difficult to establish whether a particular divestment or defunding campaign resulted in a particular law being passed.

Despite this, there are cases where it seems very likely that defunding campaigns caused legislative change.
## Evidence from fossil fuel divestment campaigns
There are powerful examples of this working in the case of fossil fuels. In fact, [Fossil fuel divestment campaigns directly changed UK pension law in 2017](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/dec/18/boost-for-fossil-fuel-divestment-as-uk-eases-pension-rules). Previously pensions were legally required to seek the best returns for their clients regardless of morality (known as “fiduciary duties”). However, after increasing pressure from fossil fuel investment campaigns, the law was changed to allow pension funds to take their client's ethical concerns into account when making investments. There is also more indirect evidence that financial campaigns can inspire regulatory change: the number of laws related to corporate sustainability has [almost tripled between 2013 and 2023](https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.unpri.org%2Fpolicy%2Fregulation-database&data=05%7C01%7Cmarti%40rsm.nl%7C5617faa4f4e6474822f608dbae59fdb1%7C715902d6f63e4b8d929b4bb170bad492%7C0%7C0%7C638295474207071901%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=ZU3kycbEnn1GGmNwOIEHqUZNY11kMLAbEez1q7CfgcM%3D&reserved=0), from around 300 to almost 900.

One way we can disentangle cause and effect is through evidence that campaigns, pressure campaigns happened *before* legislative change. [Becht et al., 2023](https://www.ecgi.global/sites/default/files/working_papers/documents/voicethroughdivestment.pdf) found that countries with net 0 pledges by the end of 2021 (23 countries) had on average 36.9 viral divestment events compared to 5.4 pledges for those that had not made net 0 pledges (15 countries). 

![Pasted image 20250320165655.png|500](/img/user/Pasted%20image%2020250320165655.png)
The path to regulation can be built off the back of many campaigns. [In Ireland](https://www.ecgi.global/sites/default/files/working_papers/documents/voicethroughdivestment.pdf), divestment campaigns from churches led to universities divesting, which eventually led to the country divesting. The country later adopted a carbon net 0 pledge. It's hard to say whether the divestment law was as symptom of rising Irish environmentalism and the net 0 would have happened just as quickly without it, but it's reasonable to assume it increased momentum for the law. 
## Evidence from other campaigns against other problematic industries
Additionally, regulation can make investing in an industry or practice illegal. One case study is in "cluster munitions" technology. Cluster munitions are bombs that split into many smaller bombs in the air, meaning they rain destruction indiscriminately across a wide area. Because of their high probability of hitting innocents, they are banned in international law since 2008. But even [in 2007, Belgium made investing in cluster bombs illegal,](https://opiniojuris.org/2007/03/03/belgium-criminalizes-investing-in-cluster-munitions/#:~:text=,or%20bonds%20in%20these%20companies) . [9 other countries since have followed](https://stopexplosiveinvestments.org/worlds-leading-financial-institutions-in-hall-of-shame-for-investments-in-cluster-munitions-producers/), though progress stalled, with the latest regulation being [Spain in 2015](https://maint.loc.gov/law/help/controversial-weapons/investments-controversial-weapons.pdf). This has also happened in fossil fuel campaigns; In 2015, California passed legislation requiring its public pension funds (CalPERS and CalSTRS) to divest from coal companies. This shows that governments are open to codifying divestment in law. While we could not find direct evidence that activists led divestment campaigns caused these regulations, It is quite clear that they can set the stage. When a divestment campaign gains strong popular support, regulators may take that as a signal that the public would favour making investment in these industries illegal.

[In India, the indigenous Dongria Kondh](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2013/aug/21/india-dongria-kondh-vedanta-resources-mining#:~:text=In%202010%2C%20the%20Church%20of,human%20rights%20of%20the%20tribe) tribe fought to prevent a London-based company, Vedanta Resources, from mining bauxite on their sacred mountain in Odisha. Alongside protests on the ground, activists engaged Vedanta’s shareholders abroad. Notably, the Church of England and other investors divested from Vedanta in 2010 over human rights concerns, increasing pressure on the company . The reputational damage – even the UK government rebuked Vedanta’s practices – helped validate the local cause. Ultimately, India’s Supreme Court and government stepped in: in 2013, in an unprecedented move, village councils were given the right to vote on the mine, and they unanimously rejected it, leading authorities to cancel Vedanta’s mining license. This is a direct example of a regulatory outcome driven by a combination of local activism and global divestment pressure.

Lastly, The case study of Philip Morris (==Link to case study==) largely defeating the tobacco divestment movement in the 1990s is somewhat relevant here. While the divestment movement did not call on policymakers to legislate against tobacco, it did call on state governments to divest their pension funds. In this case, US state legislators did not consider these divestment campaigns to represent the voice of their constituents (or perhaps more cynically, felt it was in their best interest to side with Phillip Morris over their constituents).
## A warning: when divestment calls lead to counter regulation
More recently, a worrying trend has emerged, where regulators opposed to divestment campaigns or ESG investing pass laws restricting these activities. For example, [In 2023](https://www.pleiadesstrategy.com/state-house-report-bill-tracker-republican-anti-esg-attacks-on-freedom-to-invest-responsibly-earns-business-labor-and-environmental-opposition) US Republican lawmakers in 37 states introduced 165 pieces of anti-ESG legislation (see also [here](https://www.ft.com/content/e09daf44-d3db-4a94-b607-7c6d866780b6)). There were far fewer in 2024 as [companies themselves](https://www.ropesgray.com/en/insights/viewpoints/102jniy/the-new-battleground-in-the-fight-over-esgs-role-in-public-pension-investments) have begun to challenge them. This included policies [banning state governments](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/22/rightwing-war-on-woke-capitalism-industry-interests) from dealing with institutions that boycott energy companies such as fossil fuels. This shows that defunding campaigns can lead to policy change in both ways, sometimes backfiring if lawmakers are too opposed, or if the targeted industry counter-lobbies successfully. 

However this may be less of a concern than it seems. Anti-ESG laws affect many social justice causes (animal advocates, tobacco control, climate advocates, pro-Gaza), which could unite in opposition. This may leave the movements stronger than before, by allowing for greater collaboration. As long as laws do not specifically target factory farming defunding, they may backfire, strengthening the fight against the industrial livestock industry.
## Do defunding campaigns increase public support for legislation?
One way defunding campaigns may change public attitudes is through the radical flank effect. This is where an activist group makes an extreme demand that generates lots of media attention, but which is  most of the public thinks is too extreme to be feasible. However, in doing so, the public becomes open to discussing more modest but significant proposals. See [Ostarek et al., (2024)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-024-01444-1) for an example of the radical flank effect in the climate movement. There is some evidence that the fossil fuel divestment movement served as a radical flank, shifting discussions towards other pro-climate policies. [Schifeling and Hoffman (2017)](https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/136601/1364_Hoffman.pdf;jsessionid=884005627CEF39451C1E9456C4F7613D?sequence=1) used a network analysis of over 42,000 news articles (2011–2015), the authors found that as divestment gained attention, liberal climate policies like carbon taxes moved to the center of public discourse, while conservative ideas receded. 

While they might indirectly shape policy attitudes, there is currently little evidence that they shape attitudes more directly. [A study by Schwartz et al., (2024)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/epdf/10.1080/09644016.2023.2178351?needAccess=true) found across three studies in the US, India and South Africa, that telling people about successful fossil fuel divestment campaigns does **not** increase their support for climate policy. They studied thousands of participants, in a realistic experiment where they were given information on a ficticious but realistic scenario of 1000 institutions announcing a mass divestment. Surprisingly, despite this being a core claim of the fossil fuel divestment movement, we were unable to find any other studies addressing this question with quantitative data, even after considerable searching. 

While these findings are disappointing, it does not necessarily mean these campaigns are ineffective. The study only measured policy preferences; it may have significantly influenced participant's attitudes towards the climate crisis and perception of the fossil fuel industry, even if it did not change their support for policy. On the other hand, telling people about divestment campaigns might not have influenced their attitudes if they were already well aware of the divestment movement. Real divestment campaigns may have shifted their policy preferences before the study, so the study would not be telling them anything new. More generally we should be cautious about accepting the findings of any single study on it's own, and more research is required. Lastly, we note that while genuine attitude change is ideal, technically it is not necessary for defunding campaigns to change public opinion; they only need to convince policy makers that public opinion has changed

# A warning about environmentally-based defunding campaigns
In reviewing previous and ongoing factory farming defunding campaigns, we noticed a trend of campaigns often relying on climate arguments. For example, [the landing page of the Stop Financing Factory Farming Coalition](https://stopfinancingfactoryfarming.com/) of the website features a cow and mentions a key driver of the climate crisis. These campaigns exploit the fact that many Development Finance Institutions (DFIs) have greenhouse gas emissions commitments, pointing out that they are unlikely be able to meet these targets if they continue to invest in industrial livestock. Additionally, some DFI's such the International Finance Corporation [may not even meet their own environmental lending standards](https://stopfinancingfactoryfarming.com/ifc-fails-to-address-ghg-emissions-in-agricultural-loans/) when investing in industrial livestock. While this can be a convincing narrative for generating momentum and press for these campaigns, we would like to reiterate a warning made in [Animal Ask 2022](https://c2b5df1e-0ba2-4201-9fb6-87e92e6ad2c0.usrfiles.com/ugd/c2b5df_6218d10c42f64be9873aa89da24e885b.pdf): reliance on environmental arguments could result in worse animal welfare outcomes if campaigns are successful. This is due to the "small animal replacement problem" or simply ["The small body problem"](https://bryantresearch.co.uk/insight-items/small-body-problem/), where dietary shifts away from large animals such as cows and pigs leads to people consuming more chicken and fish, resulting in greater animal suffering. As animal suffering is a key priority of Sinergia Animal, we strongly advise against relying on climate arguments in defunding campaigns. 

There are signs that this is already a risk; DFIs [support chicken initiatives](https://stopfinancingfactoryfarming.com/app/uploads/2024/10/eng-white-paper-a4-imprimible.pdf) more than other forms of animal agriculture. There is an exploding demand for protein from Global South countries, so successfully blocking cattle operations may lead to companies filling demand for meat with other livestock. Additionally, [demand for fish](https://www.rsis.edu.sg/rsis-publication/rsis/growing-food-insecurity-asias-huge-appetite-for-fish-can-it-be-met/) in East and Southeast Asia are expected increase rapidly in coming years alongside their growing middle-classes, and there is the perception that fish is good for the climate. A go resource on protein demand broken down by animal for Southeast Asia specifically can be found [here](https://gfi-apac.org/decoding-demand-the-appetite-for-alternative-proteins-in-southeast-asia/).
## A diversity of framings
To avoid the Small Body Problem, we advise ensuring campaigns use a variety of arguments, and direct limited campaign resources to chicken and fish projects.

One powerful argument is emphasising the disease and pandemic risk of industrial livestock. [This paper](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.add6681) in science argues that a shift from beef to chicken (and pork), is likely to increase the risk of pandemics and disease outbreaks, especially when those chickens are factory farmed. The recent surges of Avian Influenza has caused egg prices to skyrocket, driving increased interest in plant-based egg alternatives [in the Global North and Asia](https://gfi.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2024-State-of-anchor-report_GFI24005.pdf). [The recent campaign](https://banksforanimals.org/blog/a-historic-moment-global-call/) run by S3F with the slogan: _"World Bank: Is factory farming worth risking the next pandemic?"_ is a good example of defunding messaging that does not risk the small body problem. Disease narratives may also land well with investors, as detailed in [Sievert et al., (2024)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10460-024-10642-8). Their interviews with 15 investors/ESG analysts found that investors were well aware of the antimicrobial resistance (AMR) risks of Industrial animal agriculture. Because it is acknowledged by the WHO as a top global health threat, investors take it seriously and find it easy to convince their trustees (the people that give them money). The FAIRR initiative [has programs](https://www.fairr.org/investor-statements/antibiotics) around encouraging investors to act on AMR concerns, including a Global Investor Statement on Antibiotic Stewardship, signed by large pension super-funds.

![Pasted image 20250527214917.png|600](/img/user/Pasted%20image%2020250527214917.png)

That is not to say campaigns should avoid all environmental arguments; industrial livestock of all species, contribute towards deforestation and biodiversity loss. This is also true of industrial animal feed such as soy. The investors interviewed in [Sievert et al., (2024)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10460-024-10642-8) considered deforestation and biodiversity loss to be risks that investors should take seriously. Additionally, climate arguments can be used to fight *for* smaller bodied animals; there are many species of fish and crustaceans that have climate impacts larger than chicken (see figure below) Likewise, campaigns can highlight cases where DFIs violate their core mandate; food security and reducing poverty. For example, The IFC has been found to [make loans to industrial feed corporations](https://bankinformationcenter.cdn.prismic.io/bankinformationcenter/ZxkQjIF3NbkBX8LO_HowMuch-andHow-DoesIFCSupportIndustrialLivestockAndIsItChanging.pdf) headquartered in Singapore who source their feed from Canada, Australia, the USA and Germany.

Lastly, While the climate argument should not be the primary focus of the campaign, it can be useful to exploit the climate narrative to gain favourable press opportunities to discuss the other attitudes. For example, in this article for [Investment Week](http://web.archive.org/web/20210817150516/https://www.investmentweek.co.uk/opinion/4035929/emissions-exxon-meat-target-divestment) on livestock divestment campaigns, the hook for the article is climate. However, the author uses the platform to also talk about deforestation, animal welfare, and human rights abuses involved in industrial animal agriculture.

# Defunding campaigns vs corporate welfare campaigns: Allocating resources efficiently
Activism campaigns cannot be evaluataed in isolation. They must be evaluated relative to other campaigns an organization could do. As such, in this section we compare defunding campaigns to corporate welfare campaigns, which is another very popular campaign that animal advocacy organizations conduct, which have shown great promise. 

We compare these two campaigns against each other along a number of dimensions. We selected these dimensions because as previous sections have shown, they are thought to be key advantages of defunding campaigns (for example, discussed in [Bergman 2018](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/905d/cc93072a909e938db5935e04368a8fcd875a.pdf).

# Offering alternatives
Convincing development finance institutions to restrict funding to industrial animal agriculture is more likely to be successful if these institutions see viable alternatives to invest in. DFI's have a mandate to use their capital (i.e. money) to alleviate poverty and tackle food insecurity, which is presumably why they consider funding industrial animal agriculture in the first place. Simply halting these investments is unlikely to be successful; the money must be *diverted*. As such, It may be valuable to explore and publicise alternatives to industrial animal agriculture that can reduce food and nutrition insecurity across the world. We propose two alternatives to explore:
1. Investing in small-scale farmers
2. Investing in plant-based alternative proteins
## Investing in small-scale horticulture
Rather than investing in large multinational food corporations, we echo the S3F coalition's call that [DFIs should be investing in small-scale farmers](https://stopfinancingfactoryfarming.com/app/uploads/2025/04/unlocking-the-promise-of-smallholder-farmers--a-better-path-for-development-finance.pdf). In particular, we emphasise favouring horticulture (crops, fruits and vegetables), giving them the capital they need to work their way out of poverty and food insecurity. Small-scale farmers are among the world's poorest, so helping them is a particularly high leverage way to reduce poverty. Key problems faced by small-scale farmers are lack of access to capital (such as loans) and ways to sell their products on bigger markets. [The World Bank already recognises the importance of market access in allowing farmers to dig their way out of poverty](https://ieg.worldbankgroup.org/blog/complementary-interventions-agrifood-system-development-insights-and-lessons).

One initiative DFIs might fund are Future Smart Foods (FSF), championed by the FAO and [Bill Gates](https://www.gatesnotes.com/Fonio). These are neglected and underutilised species (NUS) that are also nutrient dense, climate resilient, economically viable, and locally available or adaptable ([FAO, 2018](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/mcn.13008)). This makes them excellent plant-based food security solutions. Promising Future Smart Foods [include “Nutricereals” such as millets](https://www.smartfood.org/activities/india/) which typically higher levels of vitamin A, calcium, iron, zinc, riboflavin, and folic acid than staple crops. [The Gates Foundation](https://www.gatesnotes.com/Fonio) alongside [CGIAR](https://www.gatesnotes.com/How-CGIAR-is-feeding-our-future) see millets as playing a promising role in addressing micronutrient deficiencies across the world. Other examples include the [Persian Moringa tree](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4471650/), able to grow in desert regions with leaves containing high levels of vitamins A and C, as well as calcium and potassium. Another example is [Chaya](https://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00K93C.pdf), or tree spinach, that is popular and native to Mexico and Central America but is grown as far as Cambodia. It grows fast, is drought and disease resistant, and high in protein, iron and vitamin C. it contain 2.2x more iron than cabbage, which is considered [a good plant source of iron.](https://www.mkuh.nhs.uk/patient-information-leaflet/good-sources-of-iron)It may also provide a good source of income to growers as it is cheap to produce and [appealing to tourists from high income countries](https://www.mdpi.com/2571-9408/4/3/83).

As discussed in the section above, DFI's often set up blended finance, where they partner with commercial lenders to create loans for projects that would otherwise be too risky or unprofitable. Blended finance can be used to crowd investors into industrial animal agriculture, but it can also be used to finance alternatives. The IFC's [Global Agriculture and Food Security Program (GAFSP) Private Sector Window ](https://www.ifc.org/en/what-we-do/sector-expertise/blended-finance/blended-finance-agribusiness)uses blended finance to support projects designed to improve the livelihoods of smallholder farmers living in the world’s poorest countries. The project claims to crowd in $6.5 of private sector funding for every $1 they invest themselves, and have deployed $475 million across 89 projects in 29 countries. Additionally the IFC has the [Inclusive Agritech Facility](https://www.ifc.org/en/what-we-do/sector-expertise/blended-finance/blended-finance-agribusiness) for investing in South Asian food tech companies for small-scale farmers, and [The Canada Facility for Resilient Food Systems](https://www.ifc.org/en/what-we-do/sector-expertise/blended-finance/blended-finance-agribusiness), a food security initiative in partnership with the government of Canada.

## Alternative proteins
In addition to small-scale farming, we propose lobbying DFI's to divert funding to affordable alternative proteins. [Alternative proteins](https://gfi.org/defining-alternative-protein/) involve creating alternatives to meat, dairy and eggs without animal farming. They include plant-based products, products created through precision fermentation, and cultivated products where animal cells are grown directly. Alternative proteins have [strong food security benefits](https://innovationcommission.uchicago.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Alternative-Proteins.pdf), producing efficient, scalable, nutritious, protein using less land with a lower environmental impact than the animal products they replace, as well as not involving animal slaughter. 

Whilst alternative proteins are typically thought of as food for rich consumers in the global north, there is significant demand for them in low and middle income countries. For example, two thirds of South African consumers are "highly likely to try" plant-base meat alternatives ([Szejda et al., 2021](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/sustainable-food-systems/articles/10.3389/fsufs.2021.744199/full?utm_source=chatgpt.com)). Similarly high numbers were found across [Egypt, Kenya and Nigeria](https://www.northmountainconsulting.com/case-study-kne-pbm). [A 2023 survey in Mexico](https://mexicobusiness.news/agribusiness/news/54-mexican-consumers-are-switching-plant-based-foods) found that 54% had already begun to replace animal products with alternative proteins. There is good demand across [most Southeast Asian countries](https://gfi-apac.org/decoding-demand-the-appetite-for-alternative-proteins-in-southeast-asia/), and [a large Chinese study](https://www.fsrfund.org/fsrf-40?utm_source=chatgpt.com) showed most had tried plant-based meats and a large number of those that hadn't were open to it. Additionally, many of these countries already have some plant-based alternative proteins on the market that have expanded internationally (e.g. [Meat Zero](https://www.meatzerobrand.com/en/) in Thailand, or [Fazenda Futuro in Brazil](https://www.industriaalimentaria.org/blog/contenido/carne-alternativa-en-latam-innovaciones-que-estan-cambiando-a-la-industria-de-alimentos)), indicating there is a market to build on.

However, despite increases in government funding and strong consumer demand, investment is [not keeping pace, and in many countries is actually declining](https://gfi.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2024-State-of-the-Industry-Plant-based-meat-seafood-eggs-dairy-and-ingredients.pdf?_gl=1%2A1f07elc%2A_up%2AMQ..%2A_ga%2AMjMxNDY4NjU1LjE3NDU5MTg5OTQ.%2A_ga_TT1WCK8ETL%2AMTc0NTkxODk5Mi4xLjEuMTc0NTkxOTA1Ni4wLjAuMA..). A [2024 academic review](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2475299123266196) concluded that despite significant market potential for alternative proteins in LMICs, there is a lack of capital to realise these opportunities. Many investors acknowledge that alternative proteins are an essential part of solving animal agriculture and the climate crisis ([Sievert et al., 2024](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10460-024-10642-8)). However, they worry investments are too speculative and risky at the moment (same study). This makes alternative proteins a perfect candidate for DFI additionality and crowding in. DFI's can play a vital role in re-risking the alternative protein sector for other investors, providing 'patient capital' and bringing in other private investment money.

Some DFI's have already acknowledged the potential of alternative proteins. The World Bank's "Recipe for a Liveable Planet" report ranks them second in a list of 26 agri-food climate interventions (a good summary of this report by The Good Food Institute can be found [here](https://gfi.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/World-Bank-report-summary.pdf)). The European [Investment Bank](https://www.proteinproductiontechnology.com/post/heura-foods-secures-eu20-million-eib-loan-to-accelerate-plant-based-innovation) has also directly invested in alternative proteins, giving Barcelona based plant-based meat brand Heura foods €20M In May 2025. The United Nations Development Programme maintains a investor platform for encouraging private investment in sectors supporting the sustainable development goals (SDGs). They list alternative proteins as a promising industry [to support multiple SDGs](https://sdgprivatefinance.undp.org/leveraging-capital/sdg-investor-platform/alternative-proteins-food-future). However note that they consider insect-based protein to also be alternative proteins so campaigns should make sure to emphasise plant-based brands and foods.

# Summary and recommendations for successful campaigns
- Stock and bond based divestment campaigns are unlikely to negatively affect the cost of capital for animal agriculture. This is because less scrupulous investors will buy the divested stocks and bonds, cancelling out the effect of activism.
- Similarly, when commercial banks make loans to finance factory farming, getting them cancelled is unlikely to successfully prevent factory farm financing as other less ethically concerned banks will step in.
	- While we would not recommend conducting these campaigns, if they are conducted, the campaigns should be seen as a stepping stone towards passing legislative change, banning the investment in industrial and agriculture, or otherwise restricting its activities. 
- While it is early days, there is some reason to suspect that campaigning against that pressuring development finance institutions to restrict financing to factory farming may be an effective strategy.
	- Most DFIs do not consistently report full details of the loans they make; a key campaign ask should be getting these institutions to increase transparency, which will facilitate holding them accountable.
- Insurance denial is an emerging strategy in defunding campaigns, particularly in fossil fuels, that may be worth exploring, but there is a lack of research on this strategy.
- Private equity firms are increasingly funding industrial animal agriculture. However, we believe there are significant barriers to successfully campaigning against them and so would not recommend it.
- The primary way that defunding campaigns could increase the cost of capital for factory farming companies is through changing investor perceptions of the riskiness of the project.
- Organisations carrying out defunding campaigns should devote cosiderable time and resources to ensuring that they get non-negative press coverage of the campaign in financial or politically conservative outlets. Stigmatising industrial animal agriculture in this way should be seen as a primary goal of the campaign, not as an indirect secondary goal. The few campaigns that have been run so far have generally achieved this goal.
- Campaigns to restrict the financing of factory farming should be careful about relying primarily on environmental or greenhouse gas emissions arguments as these can divert funding from ruminant livestock into chickens and fish causing more animal suffering in the process. Campaigns should instead focus on disease/pandemic risk, deforestation, and in the case of DFI's projects having no food security or anti-poverty benefit.

## Future work
One unfortunate takeaway of our research is that there is very limited direct research on many of the key questions in the defunding campaigns. For example, there has been to date only one study examining how divestment campaigns affect public opinion. Similarly, there is a distinct lack of studies on trust in development finance institutions and on which particular narratives are likely to work in convincing them to defund industrial livestock.


# Appendix A: Methods for press coverage of factory farm defunding
- We googled "factory farm divestment" and "defund factory farming, both times checking the top 10 pages of google search results. 
- We also checked Google news results for the queries:
	- "bank" AND "factory farm*". (4 pages returned)
	- "factory farm*" AND "loan" (2 pages returned)
	- "factory farm*" AND "divest*" (1 page returned)
	- "industrial livestock" AND "divest" (1 page returned)
	- "industrial livestock" AND "loan" (1 page returned)
	- "industrial farm" AND "divest" (4 pages returned)
	- "industrial farm" AND "loan" (1 page returned)
	- "meat" AND "divestment" (4 pages returned)
	- "livestock" AND "divestment" (3 pages returned)

In all cases, I read all articles not obviously from pro-animal outlets (NGO websites, Sentient Media, Plant-Based News, Green Queen)

We also included articles that emerged organically in the research process.
# Appendix B: Methodological issues with equity and bond divestment studies
In reviewing the literature, we noted several issues with studies that can confuse attempts to draw firm conclusions. Firstly, many studies only investigate extremely short time frames, [such as 10 days after divestment announcement](https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/11/11/3122), but report it as "divestment significantly impacted stock price". A more subtle issue is that some whilst studies show increased cost of capital for more environmentally damaging firms (E.g. [Yildiz, 2024](https://kar.kent.ac.uk/106197/1/mde.4260.pdf)) that doesn't necessarily mean divestment played any role in it. It is possible that more environmentally damaging firms are also worse investments for other reasons. A study with a similar issue [Gehricke et al., (2023)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://sustainablefinancealliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/GRASFI2023_paper_834.pdf&hl=en&sa=T&oi=gsb-ggp&ct=res&cd=0&d=4435329259358996958&ei=w_MQaOzdFrGyieoPkbCKiQE&scisig=AFWwaeYwoxr8yJTh75tHeFKAjTVj), who studied over 45,000 cases where a large investment fund (in this case, ESG focussed exchange traded funds) sold off their stake in a company. They found that when they sell off their shares, this does in fact hurt the company and increase it's cost of capital. However, this study did not establish *why* these funds sold off their stocks. Studies that cite this paper assume it was due to activists pressure, but ESG funds sell stocks for many reasons.
