1. Nutritional Yeast  
2. Marmite + Yeast Spreads (fortified) 
3. Fortified Soy + Almond Milk  
4. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Some</mark> Plant-Based Meats  
5. Fortified Cereals  
6. Tempeh  
7. Chlorella ([Maybe](https://www.b12-vitamin.com/algae/)) 
9. Cremini Mushrooms (levels can vary, so don't rely on it)

One confusing thing is that some foods contain B12 analogues that look like B12 in lab tests, but have no benefit to your health and may even interfere with real B12!
## [The vegan society](https://www.vegansociety.com/resources/nutrition-and-health/nutrients/vitamin-b12/what-every-vegan-should-know-about-vitamin-b12) have comprehensive recommendations and info around B12
"Claimed sources of B12 that have been shown through direct studies of vegans to be **inadequate** include human gut bacteria, spirulina, dried nori, barley grass and most other seaweeds. Several studies of raw food vegans have shown that raw food offers no special protection."

## Get a supplement with methylcobalamin
methylcobalamin is a naturally occurring form of B12 that can be absorbed through either dietary sources or supplements, while cyanocobalamin is a synthetic form of vitamin B12 that can only be found in supplements. Cyanocobalamin, on the other hand, is [not converted into active B12 as easily](https://www.b12-vitamin.com/supplements/).

# Are animal products a good source of B12?
Animals can be "natural" sources of B12 but most animal products you eat are not natural sources, because the animals themselves have [been given B12 (or cobalt) supplements](https://www.feedstrategy.com/blogs/feed-ingredient-insights/blog/15445375/cobalt-or-vitamin-b12-for-ruminant-feeds).

I haven't delved in but supposedly [this source](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14356007.o27_o12.pub2) claims that the feed sector buys 55% of B12 supplements
