Since January 2014, the number of people taking part in the initiative has risen year-on-year: in 2022, more than 629,000 participants officially signed up on the Veganuary website (Veganuary, 2021). Furthermore, in 2022 Veganuary estimated number of unofficial participants to be 10 times higher (thought they're going to be a bit biased). 

A 2019 survey by Vomad[^1] found that 6.5% of vegan participants (831 people) reported turning vegan from taking a vegan challenge. 44.4% (369 people) said it was Veganuary. Other popular challenges included Challenge 22+ and Vegan Easy 30-Day Challenge. This is probably a bit biased because the survey was not representative, but I don't see it being hugely off.

## Veganuary might be bad for your health if not properly planned
This study[^2] (haven't read) One misleading thing about the abstract is that, just because omnis trying veganuary showed significant declines does not mean they showed **unhealthy levels** of these nutrients.
