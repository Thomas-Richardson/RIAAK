Great article breaking it down here: https://sentientmedia.org/does-veganism-kill-more-animals

The TLDR is that, getting all your meat from hunting or purely grass fed beef might actually killed fewer animals than a vegan diet, but:
- It's not remotely scalable. A world that only ate meat from grass-fed / hunting would probably have to be mostly vegan anyway because we'd barely be able to produce any meat at all.
- Very little meat is actually produced this way. Most people eat beef that has been fed grains and that swings the dial heavily back in favour of veganism.
