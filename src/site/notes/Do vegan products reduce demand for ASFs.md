## Yes
- [Bryant, Ross and Flores (2023)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950329323000484) found that people reporting increases in PBMAs reported lower animal product consumption (non causal)
- Among consumers who buy plant-based meat, 49% of these individuals said they would have bought beef otherwise, and 38% said they would have bought chicken otherwise ([Tonsor, Lusk & Schroder, 2021](https://www.agmanager.info/sites/default/files/pdf/PlantBasedProteinAlternatives_FullReport.pdf)).
- The average amount of plant-based meat consumed per person increased by 8.1% in 2022 (Statista, [2023](https://www.statista.com/forecasts/1276683/united-kingdom-meat-substitute-consumption-per-capita)). Conversely, fresh meat consumption decreased 7.3% and processed meat consumption decreased by 2.6% in 2022 (Statista, [2023](https://www.statista.com/forecasts/679528/per-capita-meat-consumption-european-union-eu)). (from [[Alternative Meats Displace Demand for Animal Products\|Bryant insight here]])
- Data from University College London indicates that using oatmilk by default increases oatmilk drinks sold and decreases cow’s milk drinks sold in equal proportion, suggesting that plant-based defaults successfully displace animal-based options. Four student union cafes — Gordon’s Café, Print Room Café, Bloomsbury Café, and George Farha Café — implemented an oatmilk default policy in April 2022, and according to data shared with the Better Food Foundation, oatmilk orders fully doubled (21% → 42%) over the following year. https://defaultveg.medium.com/the-oat-never-bothered-me-anyway-a91cfe78ad63

## No
Modelling by [[Citations/Lusk et al., 2022\|Lusk et al., 2022]] suggests that even large decreases in the price of PBMAs would not lead to much change in the number of cows in the US

A report by Good Growth reports that <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">asian</mark> found that consumers didn't intend to eat less meat, but had a really positive view of meat alts and would eat them more. It seems that not only would meat alts not displace, they don't even compete!

- [[Citations/Malan et al., 2022\|Malan et al., 2022]] dining hall study comparing impossible beef to regular beef showed 29% picked it despite price and convenience parity and potentially close to taste parity.
