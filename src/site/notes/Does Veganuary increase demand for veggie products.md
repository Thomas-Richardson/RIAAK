Workplace cafetarias experience increased sales of vegan options even a year after Veganuary campaigns ([[Citations/McPhedran et al., 2023\|McPhedran et al., 2023]])

Also this study[^1] found in 154 stores that veganuary boosted sales of plant based products by 57% during and even remained 15% higher during Feb and march. However meat sales did not decline.

However, [[Citations/Luick et al., 2023\|Luick et al., 2023]] found that PB food sales increased during Veganuary only when the products were promoted, and the increase in sales did not last beyond January.

[Luick et al,. (2024)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12889-024-19080-x) found that during Veganuary PB foods did see increased sales, but did if they were on promotion. After the promotion they declined again
