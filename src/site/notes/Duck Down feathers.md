- Down is three times as warm as any made-made fiber. It is so efficient that humans have yet to create anything better.
- It requires the feathers of 75 birds to fill one down comforter. The size of the down market was $7.5 billion in 2023, projected to reach $16 billion over the next decade.[2](https://www.goodsignal.com/p/the-down-side#footnote-2-146050380) 270,000 metric tons of down are produced annually. 80 percent is produced in China, and 90 percent comes from ducks.[3](https://www.goodsignal.com/p/the-down-side#footnote-3-146050380)
- *Duck down* has comparably smaller clusters and is less expensive than goose down.
- 3.4 billion ducks and geese are slaughtered every year in the production of down and feathers for use in the fashion industry alone.[4](https://www.goodsignal.com/p/the-down-side#footnote-4-146050380)
- There are three methods to remove down from a bird’s body – post mortem (taking feathers after the bird is killed for meat), gathering (collecting fallen feathers or brushing/combing to remove feathers), and live plucking (ripping feathers from live birds).
- This process begins when the bird is 10 weeks old, and repeats every six weeks until slaughter. Live plucking is the prevalent method, as it produces higher quality down material
- European Down and Feather Association (EDFA) and the International Down and Feather Testing Laboratory (IDFL), 98 to 99 percent of total production is a byproduct of the food industry.[5](https://www.goodsignal.com/p/the-down-side#footnote-5-146050380) However, an investigation by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) found that out of 66 Chinese suppliers, nearly half sold wholesale quantities of live plucked down.[6](https://www.goodsignal.com/p/the-down-side#footnote-6-146050380) A Swedish documentary also revealed that 50-80 percent of the down on the market was coming from live birds.[7](https://www.goodsignal.com/p/the-down-side#footnote-7-146050380)
- Dust mites, which are microscopic, insect-like pests that live in house dust, can accumulate in down products over time, triggering allergic reactions.
- Down is often treated with chemicals and antimicrobial agents that bind dust and fibers to down clusters, known as ‘glue down’. This poses health risks, including respiratory issues and skin irritation.
- Over time, exposure to allergens may lead to more serious conditions such as lung inflammation, known as ‘feather duvet lung’.[9](https://www.goodsignal.com/p/the-down-side#footnote-9-146050380)
- Chemical treatments such as dyes, waterproofing, or anti-microbial finishes significantly reduce its biodegradability. Synthetic dyes release toxic substances that harm the environment while waterproofing agents like polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) persist in the environment without readily degrading.[10](https://www.goodsignal.com/p/the-down-side#footnote-10-146050380)
- Ethical down certifications include the [Responsible Down Standard](https://textileexchange.org/app/uploads/2021/02/RDS-101-V3.0-2019.07.01.pdf) (RDS) and the [Global Traceable Down Standard](https://www.nsf.org/knowledge-library/sustainable-down-certifications) (GTDS). Both certify farms where birds are free from unnecessary harm, including no live plucking or force-feeding, with respect for the [Five Freedoms](https://www.aspca.org/sites/default/files/upload/images/aspca_asv_five_freedoms_final1.ashx_.pdf) of animal welfare
- Products that are RDS- or GTDS-certified are labeled as such and can be traced using the [Track My Down](http://trackmydown.com/) service to verify their authenticity.
