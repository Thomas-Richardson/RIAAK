The Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN). FADN collects annual surveys carried out by EU countries. It is the only source of microeconomic data that is harmonised at the European level. 

Used in [[Greenpeace, 2024\|Greenpeace, 2024]] where there's a full description of the data

The annual
sample covers approximately 80,000 farm holdings,
which represent a population of about 3.5 million
commercial farms in the EU, covering about 90% of
farmed agricultural land (utilised agricultural area). In
FADN, holdings are categorised into groups based
on their economic size (defined by the holdingsâ€™
gross production at farm gate prices, also known as
total standard output/SO), region, and specialisation.
Each holding in the sample is representative of
similar holdings and are given a weight according
to the number of farms they represent to derive
an average. Approximately 5.5 million very small
subsistence farms are not covered.
