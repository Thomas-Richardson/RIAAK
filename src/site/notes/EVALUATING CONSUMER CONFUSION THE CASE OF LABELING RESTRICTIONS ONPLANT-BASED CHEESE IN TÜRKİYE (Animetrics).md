Factory farming causes serious harm to
non-human animals, communities, and
the planet. The growing plant-based food
market presents a vital opportunity to
challenge these injustices and drive
positive change. Yet this progress is
threatened by restrictive labeling laws,
such as banning terms like “cheese” or
“meat” for plant-based products. These
policies, often justified by claims of
consumer confusion, lack evidence to
prove their effectiveness and risk creating
unnecessary barriers to consumer choice
and innovation.
To effectively address these challenges,
advocacy must be grounded in rigorous
research and evidence. In a movement

driven by justice and urgency, evidence-
based analysis is what empowers us to

challenge assumptions, dismantle
ineffective policies, and promote solutions
that create meaningful, systemic change.
Advocacy rooted in research doesn’t stop at
identifying problems; it uncovers credible,
actionable pathways forward.
This is where causal analysis becomes
essential. By distinguishing causation
from correlation, we can measure the real
impact of labeling practices and assess
whether restrictive policies achieve their
intended goals. More importantly, this
approach allows us to identify effective
solutions that reduce confusion, empower
consumers, and support the growth of
ethical, sustainable food systems.

This whitepaper marks a decisive step in
that direction. Through comprehensive
analysis grounded in experimental
economics and econometrics, we provide
clear insights into how labeling practices
influence consumer understanding. Our
goal is to equip advocates, policymakers,
and industry leaders with the tools they
need to make informed, evidence-based
decisions.
At Animetrics, we believe in solutions that
empower people to make ethical choices,
remove unnecessary barriers, and pave
the way for a food system that values
justice: for non-human animals, for
human animals, and for the planet.
This report is not just about
understanding the problem; it is about
making progress. Let’s use what we know
to move forward together; rooted in
evidence, committed to change.
