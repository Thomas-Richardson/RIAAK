#labelling 

While research on the impact of ecolabels on consumer behavior is mixed, most studies find a marginal influence on behavior. A recent study by [Tiboni-Oschilewski et al.](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11005915/) found that a clear positive trend between ecolabels and consumer behaviour was most prominent when consumers already had some awareness and concern about environmental impacts.
