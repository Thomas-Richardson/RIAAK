## Climate funders
- Much bigger, slower and bureaucratic than animal funders: it can take a year to get that bread!
- Actively listen to them about whether they're interested in practical details about you, or your mission.
- The climate movement is fragmented. Because food is new to climate there are hundreds of climate events and it's hard to find the right people. you probably won't be successful just attending these events and hoping to bump into people. Climate funders and conferences are extremely broad, so you need to make a tight, concise case. Network though personal connections not conferences
	- Engaging with climate funders though Linkedin is useful
	- All the good climate events are invite only, and not advertised.
- Go through their website and see what are they funding and what language do they use to describe their programs.
	- If they say "Less meat" or "protein diversification" or "more plants" **use their language**
	- Focus on overconsumption of meat in developed world
	- Don't talk about animals, they don't care about number of animals saved.
- Many funders require KPIs on methane and GHGs. These KPIs are not on the website but they'll love to tell you if you ask
	- Ask about their values, and their KPIs?
- Climate funders are wary of political spats with ranchers and such, so aim for more plants rather than less meat
- We should draw attention to how quick our modern diet has change
