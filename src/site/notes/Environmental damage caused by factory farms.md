The key ways factory farms pollute the environment are:
- Ammonia pollution
- particulate matter
- phosphate
- nitrogen

## [Ammonia](https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/stories/2024-04-26/what-is-ammonia-and-how-is-it-harmful/) 
- Releases ammonia gas into the air
- Ammonia is a made of hydrogen and nitrogen so is a major source of nitrogen pollution
- They seep into soil and water and damage things
- Breathing in ammonia can cause a burning sensation, and high concentrations can even be fatal. But it doesn’t need to be direct exposure to cause harm. In the air, ammonia mixes with other gases including sulphur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide. When this happens, tiny particles called fine particulate matter are created that contain ammonium. Breathing in these tiny particles can harm your health. They’re especially bad for your heart and lungs, and can lead to heart attacks, strokes, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, asthma and even lung cancer
- [This 2019 report by the Woodland trust](https://www.woodlandtrust.org.uk/media/1687/ammonia-impacts-on-ancient-woodland.pdf) details how Ammonia and Nitrogen from CAFOs can impact nearby ancient woodlands, describing it as " one of the greatest threats to ancient woodlands in the UK."
- [A 180,000 bird CAFO near Newsborough Warren](https://nora.nerc.ac.uk/id/eprint/504357/1/N0504357PP.pdf), North Wales emits so much ammonia and Nitrogen that is exceeds critical levels even 2.8km *upwind*.

[According to Sustain](https://www.sustainweb.org/news/jun23-industrial-agriculture-toxic-waste/), every hour, industrially reared chickens, pigs and dairy cows generate the equivalent of well over 100 double decker buses of toxic poo, or 50,000 tonnes a day. In 42 areas in the UK, nitrogen pollution is so acute that councils are unable to approve any housing developments that may add more nitrogen to the environment; an extreme measure to prevent further harm to sensitive habitats.

## Soil

## UK livestock waste is underreported
[TBIJ](https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/stories/2024-04-26/air-pollution-surging-across-poultry-megafarming-hotspots/) and the i have also uncovered regulatory loopholes that mean significant amounts of emissions are currently going unreported. ‘The findings provide yet another reason for applications for new US-style megafarms to be rejected’. According to current rules, any farm housing fewer than 40,000 birds is not required to report its ammonia emissions. Figures show almost 20 million birds are currently reared on farms that fall below this threshold. Emissions from farms’ waste consignments, meanwhile, can go unreported altogether because there is no requirement for a farm to monitor waste that leaves its site.

per site might not be an issue but the sites are getting more concentrated: This is a real weakness as you do not have a single ammonia emission limit set as a collective [for the region].
