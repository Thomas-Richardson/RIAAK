## Engagement Overview

### What are investor engagements?

**Engagement** refers to the process undertaken by an institutional investor, or a group of institutional investors, to engage in a dialogue to discuss material risks and opportunities with companies with the aim of achieving long term business resilience and sustainable value for investor portfolios.

Investors may enter into an engagement for the following reasons:

1. Individual investors may have limited access to companies due to the size of their holdings.
2. The greater the aggregate support for an issue – in number of investors and AUM – the stronger the signal it sends to both target companies and the wider market.
3. Knowledge building. Investors may not have the technical knowledge to launch their own engagement and want to learn from experts or other investors.
4. FAIRR facilitates engagements on behalf of its investor members, supporting investor stewardship or engagement teams who typically have limited capacity to engage many companies in their portfolio. The FAIRR team coordinates the process and provides administrative support.

![Engagement-overview](https://images.ctfassets.net/kc2xclar6nri/CMtbGgWFQzVAgn5CMKkAa/68865457c84546c95c4e8b94353e8152/Engagement-overview.jpg?w=975)

### How do engagements work?

FAIRR facilitates investor engagements for our members. FAIRR’s investor engagements provide the opportunity for dialogue around topics which contribute to long term business resilience and sustainable value of investee companies.

FAIRR’s engagements are underpinned by assessment frameworks which are informed by leading academics, industry experts, investors and corporates and those are used to measure and report on company progress.

The engagement process is structured around 4 fundamental actions:

1. Formal notification of companies via an engagement letter signed by supporting investors;
2. Formal dialogue with companies in meetings held with small group of investor representing the broader coalition;
3. Measuring company progress based on primary (company response to letter and meetings) and secondary (public disclosure including company websites, media, reports) data;
4. Reporting on progress against the engagement objective.

### Report Launch: From Farms to Forks: Antibiotic Stewardship

In May 2023, FAIRR launched two engagements; Animal Pharmaceuticals (Phase 2) and Restaurant Antibiotics (Phase 1). The engagements aim to improve transparency around how companies operating at different stages of the protein value chain are working to ensure responsible antibiotic use at the farm level.

The report highlights key findings, provides company-specific examples, and explains how companies could improve disclosure to demonstrate that they are addressing the systemic risk of AMR.

### Report Launch: Waste & Pollution Engagement

In September 2022, FAIRR launched a first-of-its-kind collaborative investor engagement aiming to drive ten global pork and poultry producers to conduct meaningful risk assessments around their management of manure and animal waste and to put in place action plans that reduce their impact on biodiversity. The Phase 1 Progress Report discusses how these companies assess the risks driven by the pollution across their value chains and also offers investors best practice examples. The report includes suggestions for follow-up engagement questions, a discussion of the potential opportunities of nutrient circularity, as well as granular data on the performance of companies against the assessment framework.
