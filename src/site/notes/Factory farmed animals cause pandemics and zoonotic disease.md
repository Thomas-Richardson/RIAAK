The last pandemic before COVID emerged from farm animals. This was the 2009 swine flu pandemic that started in Mexico, close to a major concentration of industrial pig farms.

Diseases that have historically caused high levels of damage are: Classical Swine Fever (CSF), African Swine Fever (ASF), Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE, known as "Mad Cow Disease"), Foot-and-Mouth Disease (FMD) and Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza, (HPAI, known as "bird flu").

in 2021-2022 avian influenza caused 2,467 outbreaks in poultry in Europe, resulting in the slaughter of 47.7 million domestic birds in 37 countries ([European Food Safety Authority, 2022](https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/news/avian-influenza-unprecedented-number-summer-cases-europe)).
