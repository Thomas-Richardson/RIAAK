- We could easily meet all extra food needs from a growing population even out to 2050 if we just ate more of the crops we feed to animals ([[Citations/Berners-Lee, Watson and Hewitt 2018\|Berners-Lee, Watson and Hewitt 2018]])
- in 2007, 25% of fish were fed to farm animals [[Citations/Erb et al., 2012\|Erb et al., 2012]]
- [[Citations/Cassidy et al., 2013\|Cassidy et al., 2013]] argue that if we stopped using crops for feeding animals and simply fed those crops to humans, we could feed an additional 4 billion people and increase calories available to humanity by 70%
- At global level, human-edible feed materials represented about 14% of the global livestock feed ration. Grains made up only 13% of the ration, but represented 32% of global grain production in 2010 [[Citations/Mottet et al., 2017\|Mottet et al., 2017]]
- In the EU and U.S. around two-thirds of cereals are used as animal feed. Globally the figure [is 40%](https://www.openaccessgovernment.org/livestock-production/129347/)
- [[Citations/Shepon, Eshel, Noor and Milo, 2018\|Shepon, Eshel, Noor and Milo, 2018]] found that if the US replaced their animal products with plant-based replacements for each of the major animal categories in the United States (beef, pork, dairy, poultry, and eggs) can produce 2 to 20 x more nutritionally similar food per unit cropland.
- 20% of soy is eaten by humans, mostly in soybean oil. tofu and soy milk are just 7%. 77% is fed to livestock ([[Citations/Ritchie, 2021\|Ritchie, 2021]])
	- Over one-third (37%) of global soy is fed to chickens and other poultry; one-fifth to pigs; and 6% for aquaculture. Very little soy is used for beef and dairy production â€“ only 2%.

Sub-Saharan Africa is already a net importer of grains [[Citations/Erb et al., 2012\|Erb et al., 2012]], almost all of which are for human consumption so increasing animal production is likely to increase imports and increase food-feed competition.

Note that the % of agri land that goes to towards feed is actually lower than in the 70s: https://www.ocl-journal.org/articles/ocl/full_html/2014/04/ocl140020/ocl140020.html
