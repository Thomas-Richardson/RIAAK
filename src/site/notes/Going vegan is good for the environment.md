- A milder version of this argument: [[Modest meat reduction can have significant environmental benefits\|Modest meat reduction can have significant environmental benefits]] 
- [[vegan pets could be much better for the environment\|vegan pets could be much better for the environment]]
- [[food and meat accounts for a large proportion of greenhouse gas emissions\|food and meat accounts for a large proportion of greenhouse gas emissions]]

- [[Citations/Conrad, Drewnowski, & Love, (2023)\|Conrad, Drewnowski, & Love, (2023)]] find that vegan diet was better for the environment than other popular diets (Low grain, low carb, low fat, and fasting)
- [[Citations/Scarborough et al., 2014\|Scarborough et al., 2014]] estimate that vegans have half the GHG emissions from diet than moderate meat eaters.
- [[Citations/Ivanova et al., 2020\|Ivanova et al., 2020]] reviewed 53 studies and found that veganism reduced carbon emissions by about half what going car free did
- [[Citations/Scarborough et al., 2023\|Scarborough et al., 2023]] reviewed 570 life-cycle assessments covering more than 38,000 farms in 119 countries and found that

## Impactful stats
a small steak causes about 5kg of carbon emissions (equivalent to approximately half an hour of driving), while an equivalent portion of a vegetarian meat-replacement is responsible for less than 0.5kg of carbon.

A review by [[Citations/Aleksandrowicz et al., 2016\|Aleksandrowicz et al., 2016]][^1] found decreases in GHGE of 3% to 36% when meat from ruminant animals (eg, beef or lamb) was replaced with meat from monogastric animals (eg, chicken or pork), and decreases of 15% to 58% with changes to vegetarian diets.

[[Citations/Berners-Lee et al., 2012\|Berners-Lee et al., 2012]] estimated that if the UK followed a veggie/vegan diet (they modelled 6 options to do this), we could reduce the UK's GHG by 22-26%, equivalent to taking half the UKs vehicles off the road.

[[Citations/Springmann et al., 2023\|Springmann et al., 2023]] estimate that the health and economic gains from going PB could be huge

## How much is my personal GHG emissions reduced by going vegan?
There are 2 things to consider here:
- What is the reduction in your ==dietary== GHG emissions?
- What is the reduction in your total, personal GHG emissions?
