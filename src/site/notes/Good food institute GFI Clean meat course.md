We've only explored 8% of the worlds plant proteins as potential meat sources, or 1% of the 150 crops used in agriculture. GFI have been looking at neglected crops . Candidates need to respond well to gelations, emulsification and stabilisation.

Breeding plants for easy protein extraction will help. Interestingly soy and wheat have been optimised for oil and starch not protein so even room for innovation there.

## Areas for development
- Novel binders that don\'t degrade under heat
- High water holding proteins to keep the product juicy

Some plant based meats can be freeze dried and don't require the same intensive cold supply chain of animal meat. Plant based meat may be more flexible in supply than animal meat as it doesn't require the breeding and slaughter of animals

The impossible burger has 21g protein per burger more than 19g for beef, uses 1/20 land, 1/4 water and produces 1/8th green house gasses

Clean meat would use up to 45% less land 99% less land, 82% less water and produce 78% less greenhouse gasses. 

Millenials are concerned about meats calories, sat fats and cholesterol. Plants have no cholesterol.

People want to 'eat clean' 

Pumpkin, chia and quinoa are complete proteins

Most of us are eating double the amount of meat that our grandparents ate.

Most meats contain blends of fats, some are liquid at room temp and some are not, allowing meat to be squishy and juicy at the same time. Most plant oils melt at room temp so fats need to be engineered. Adipocytes are cells that hold a droplet of fat until burst e.g. by chewing. This makes meat juicy.

The cost of cell culture media is the biggest factor in scaling clean meat.

Clean meat can be scaffolded onto plants like jackfruit. We use scaffolds in artificial organs
