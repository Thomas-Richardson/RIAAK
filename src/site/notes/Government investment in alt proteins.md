[The Department of Energy invested close](https://sentientmedia.org/investing-in-lab-grown-meat/) to $8.4 billion in renewable and clean power technologies in 2020, which in turn kicked off a [massive surge in solar and wind power capacity](https://www.whitehouse.gov/cea/written-materials/2024/04/11/the-next-phase-of-electricity-decarbonization-planned-power-capacity-is-nearly-all-zero-carbon/) over the next four years. We spent as much as [49 times more on energy innovation than food](https://thebreakthrough.org/issues/food-agriculture-environment/public-financing-for-agricultural-decarbonization-and-abundance) technologies

In a similar phase in the development of renewable energy, from 2004-12, Abhi Kumar estimates that governments invested about $30B in renewable R&D, matching private investment roughly 1:1. By contrast, recent government funding for alternative protein R&D has lagged private investment by about 12:1.

A decade ago, almost no government had mentioned alternative proteins — let alone funded them. Today they’re in China’s five-year agricultural [plan](https://time.com/6143109/china-future-of-cultivated-meat/), the European Union’s [protein strategy](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/BRIE/2023/751426/EPRS_BRI(2023)751426_EN.pdf), the Japanese Prime Minister’s [plans](https://www.newfoodmagazine.com/news/190034/japans-prime-minister-plans-to-develop-a-cultivated-meat-industry/), and even the US Department of Agriculture’s research [priorities](https://www.foodnavigator-usa.com/Article/2024/01/17/usda-we-will-need-cellular-agriculture-to-reach-climate-food-innovation-goals).
