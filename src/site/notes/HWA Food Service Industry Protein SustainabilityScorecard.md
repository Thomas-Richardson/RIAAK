# Executive Summary

The fourth annual **Food Service Industry Protein Sustainability Scorecard (April 2025)** evaluates the largest U.S. food-service management companies on how credibly they’re shifting menus toward lower-emission proteins. It assesses three evidence-based areas: **menu transparency**, **company goals** (plant-based share and animal-protein-reduction targets), and **plan of action** (implementation steps). A “plant-based meal” is defined as a full meal free of meat, seafood, eggs, and dairy. The report frames this within the wider climate context: global food production contributes roughly **20–37% of anthropogenic greenhouse-gas emissions**, with animal products responsible for most of that footprint.

## Big picture results
- Among the top 50 companies, **18** have plant-based commitments and **9** have explicit animal-protein-reduction commitments.  
- **Six companies earned A grades (A+/A):** Guckenheimer, Sodexo USA, Metz Culinary Management, HHS, Elior North America, and Fresh Ideas.  
- **Eight more** earned B+/B grades, indicating broader momentum but uneven progress across the sector.

## Leaders and momentum
- **Guckenheimer**: ~**51% plant-based** average today; commitment to **55% by 2025** and **≥25% food-related GHG reduction by 2030**.  
- **Sodexo USA**: **49% plant-based** on campus planned menus (31% patient, 27% retail), nearing its **50% by 2025** target.  
- **Fresh Ideas**: **31–35% plant-based** across menus; Mindful Fork concept shows **~21–40% take-rates**; adopted an animal-protein-reduction goal through 2025.  
- **Metz Culinary Management**: **41–45% plant-based** while progressing toward 50%.

## Eye-opening impact statistics
- **Whitsons Culinary Group**: ~**617,000 lbs CO₂e avoided**, roughly **713,000 miles** of driving.  
- **Southwest Foodservice Excellence (SFE) K-12 pilot**: **>16,300 lbs CO₂e saved in one month** across seven accounts; ≈ **18,600 miles** not driven and **~600,000 smartphones charged**.  
- **Elior North America**: ~**27,700 lbs CO₂e** eliminated via virtual training and plant-based menu pilot.

## Who’s on track & new targets
- On track for near-term goals: **Guckenheimer** (55% plant-based; 2030 GHG cut), **Sodexo (campus)** (49% → 50% by 2025), **Fresh Ideas** (toward 50% plus reduction goal), **LPM/Epicurean Feast Cafés** (~40% plant-based with reduction through 2025).  
- New or expanded targets: **Pomptonian** (30% plant-based in menu system by **2027**), **SFE** (animal-protein-purchase reduction by **2028** with a glidepath), **SLA Management** (**one-third plant-based by 2027**).

## Accountability gaps
- Several grades dropped due to non-participation or insufficient supplemental data.  
- A sizeable group of firms **still does not report** to the scorecard, underscoring transparency and verification gaps.

## What the report includes
- A **ranked league table** of major contractors.  
- **Company profiles** with current plant-based share, targets, verification status, and tailored recommendations.  
- **Methods** and scoring framework, including documentation standards and **glidepaths** to assess credible progress over time.  
- **Consumer guidance** for engaging dining operators to increase plant-based offerings.

## Bottom line
The transition is **accelerating but uneven**. A critical mass of major contractors now has measurable plant-based and protein-reduction goals, with several already delivering **quantifiable emissions reductions** through menu design and operations. Persistent **non-reporting and weak transparency** remain barriers to sector-wide progress.
