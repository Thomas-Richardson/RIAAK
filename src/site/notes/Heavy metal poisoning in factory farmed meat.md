Dioxins, heavy metals like mercury and cadmium, and pesticide residues build up in the fatty tissues of animals, especially those raised in industrial settings. These risks have been well-documented by the [U.S. Environmental Protection Agency](https://www.epa.gov/dioxin/learn-about-dioxin), and National Institutes of Health.

Dioxins are among the most toxic substances known to science. According to [the EPA](https://www.epa.gov/dioxin), more than 90 percent of typical human exposure is through the intake of animal fats. Dioxins are produced as byproducts of waste incineration and industrial manufacturing, and they concentrate in animal fat through contaminated feed and environmental exposure. Long-term exposure to even low levels of dioxins is linked to [cancer, immune dysfunction](https://www.epa.gov/dioxin/learn-about-dioxin) and [reproductive](https://iris.epa.gov/ChemicalLanding/&substance_nmbr=1024) and development harm.

Heavy metals like cadmium and mercury also concentrate up the food chain, particularly in organ meats, dairy and seafood.

Those chemicals don’t just stay in the soil — they accumulate in animal tissue, fat and milk, eventually [ending up on our plates](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38128207/) and in our bodies and those of our children. A comprehensive [2024 study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38128207/) found that meat and dairy contribute significantly to human pesticide exposure, with livestock and poultry accounting for 39 percent of overall exposure and whole milk and dairy products accounting for 22 percent of all exposures.

Some of the most dangerous pesticides, such as DDT and other persistent organic pollutants, don’t simply vanish when they’re banned. They are lipophilic, meaning they dissolve and store in fat, [especially animal fats](https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxguides/toxguide-35.pdf). Even decades after DDT was banned, it is still found in measurable levels in [butter](https://toxinfreeusa.org/pesticides-in-butter-getting-worse-not-better/), meat and [breast milk](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/mcn.13759).

For example, in 2023, out of 531 butter samples, [DDE (a DDT metabolite) was detected in 188 samples (35 percent)](https://www.afdo.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/800-1615-Food-Chemistry-101-Jason-Kong.pdf) and in 2021, bifenthrin (a neurotoxic insecticide) was found in 37 percent of butter samples tested. Essentially, foods that should be simple staples, such as a pat of butter on your toast, can still carry the chemical legacy of dangerous farming practices from generations ago.
