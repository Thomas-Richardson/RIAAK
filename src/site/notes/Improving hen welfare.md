## Reducing the suffering of chickens through welfare improvements
- The Welfare Footprint Project’s studied the suffering reduction that occurs when producers adopt the European Chicken Commitment⁷ for broilers and cage-free systems for hens.
- For broilers, [they found](https://welfarefootprint.org/broilers) that compared to a conventional broiler, a broiler raised in ECC standards experiences:
	- 81% less excruciating pain (25s less)
	- 65% less disabling pain (32h less)
	- 23% less hurtful pain (78h less)
	- 5% more annoying pain (15h more)
- For hens, [they found](https://welfarefootprint.org/research-projects/laying-hens/) that compared to a battery-caged hen, a cage-free hen experiences:
	- 20% less excruciating pain (36s less)
	- 64% less disabling pain (275h less)
	- 57% less hurtful pain (2,314h less)
	- 69% less annoying pain (4,645h less)
