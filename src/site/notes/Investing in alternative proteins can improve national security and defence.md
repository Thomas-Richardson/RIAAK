GFI argue here: https://gfi.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/DoD_DPA_Recommendation_RFI_2023.pdf. They also argue that it protects US national interests and military security. 

## Cultivated meat can improve national security by improving food security:
- More robust supply chains
	- they're smaller and more localised
	- Production processes like fermentation, plant-based food manufacturing, and cellular agriculture require fewer inputs and supply chain links.
	- Production can happen anywhere
- Reducing agricultural bioterrorism risks
- Reduce food system vulnerability to animal disease (see [[Factory farmed animals cause pandemics and zoonotic disease\|Factory farmed animals cause pandemics and zoonotic disease]])
- Diversifies food system
- Counters ongoing food sector consolidation

## Misc
- The Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) recently published a report concluding that investment in alternative protein technologies would provide significant strategic benefit to the United States[^1]
