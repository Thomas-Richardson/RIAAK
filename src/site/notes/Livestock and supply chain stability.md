The food and drink sector is among the most vulnerable to supply chain shocks ([FSA, 2023](https://www.food.gov.uk/print/pdf/node/17681)) meaning that stabilising our food system is particularly important. This means simplifying wherever we can. 

Worryingly, suddenly being forced to change the source of an ingredient can result in safety issues because quality control and safety procedures need to be rapidly redrawn.
