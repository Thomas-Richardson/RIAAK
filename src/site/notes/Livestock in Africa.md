Africa’s livestock accounts for one-third of the global livestock population (AU-IBAR, 2016) and about 40% of agricultural GDP in Africa, ranging from 10% to 80% in individual countries (Panel, 2020). Livestock will be increasingly important in the future in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) because the demand for animal-source food (ASF) is projected to increase due to population growth, increased incomes, and urbanization. By 2050, consumers in low- and middle-income countries will demand 107 million tons more meat and 5.5 million tons more milk than they did in 2005/2007 (Alexandratos and Bruinsma, 2012).
