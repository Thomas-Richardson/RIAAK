[70%](https://www.cpre.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/The_future_of_pig_and_poultry_farming.pdf) of the UKâ€™s imported pig meat does not meet British pig farming standards.

## Low welfare imports reduce UK food security
The UK does not require imported meat to follow the same welfare standards as UK-produced does. The claimed rationale for this is pragmatic: requiring other countries to follow UK animal welfare laws could be burdensome and result in them selling their product to another country. As a result, the UK may struggle meet its demand for meat. 

Whilst this makes it seem like lower welfare imports boosts UK food security, this neglects the effect these imports have on UK farmers. Allowing foreign imports to ignore the rules can allow them to sell their products for a cheaper price. While this may result in cheaper meat for consumers, it erodes the margins of UK farmers to the point where they are unable to make a profit.
