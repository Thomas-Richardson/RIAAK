It's a big dashboard

**The Farmed Animal Opportunity Index (FAOI)** by Mercy For Animals ranks 60 countries on their potential for effective interventions using 19 relevant socioeconomic indicators. The FAOI is an interactive tool designed to aid animal protection organizations and donors in making data-based decisions on how best to allocate their resources in a global context, with the overarching goal of maximizing impact for farmed animals. A higher score implies a higher potential for effective intervention.
