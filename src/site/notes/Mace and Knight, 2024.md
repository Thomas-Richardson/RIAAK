> A survey of backyard chicken owners

- Non-commercial chickens may be the third most numerous pets in Western countries. 
- Yet, to date, there is limited research into their welfare or the care-taking practices and attitudes of their guardians. 
- Using a quantitative questionnaire, this study investigated non-commercial chicken owners' care-taking practices, attitudes, and relationship types with their chickens. 
	- Additionally, the study investigated barriers to optimizing non-commercial chicken welfare. 
	- Specific questions were asked regarding niche care-taking practices, including the use of Suprelorin® implants. 
- With 2000+ responses, this study found variable care-taking practices, yet largely positive attitudes towards chickens, and a "personal" (though not "close personal") owner-chicken relationship, as defined by the Owner-Bird Relationship Scale. 
- The Chicken Attitude Scale, Owner-Bird Relationship Scale, and Care Series scores were found to be correlated with each other, with coefficients ranging from 0.176 to 0.543 (_p_ < 0.001). 
- "Preventing commercial chickens from going to slaughter" was a key motive for chicken care by 56.1% of respondents, with 69.6% of respondents stating they cared for ex-commercial chickens. 
- This study found a higher prevalence of reported poor health conditions and number of deaths relative to prior studies, and egg yolk peritonitis emerged as a leading health condition and cause of death. 
- Moreover, 68.0% had not heard of Suprelorin® implants, and only 6.3% used implants. 
- Most (76.4%) chicken carers followed an omnivorous diet that includes chicken meat/eggs. 
- The results reinforced previous findings concerning a need for more avian-specialist, locally available, and affordable veterinary care for chickens. Research into Suprelorin® implants, rooster-specific care, and tailored requirements of caring for ex-commercial chickens is recommended.
