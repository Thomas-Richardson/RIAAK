## Animals provide fertilisers
In Europe, the share of manure in total nitrogen inputs was estimated at 38% and as much as 61% in the Netherlands ([European Commission, 2012](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Agri-environmental_indicator__gross_nitrogen_balance))

Animal waste/manure management causes [9.5% of all GHG emissions](http://www.fao.org/3/i3437e/i3437e.pdf) from global livestock production.

### It may not be scalable
It is relatively expensive to extract high quality, easily transportable fertiliser from a wet organic mess. In any case, there wouldn’t be enough to enable us to feed the populations we have now, let alone the population we’ll have in thirty years’ time.
## CAFOs produce too much manure to be used effectively
#factory_farming 
[A previous study of CAFOs in Michigan](Spatiotemporal land use change and environmental degradation surrounding CAFOs in Michigan and North Carolina) found that operators were primarily applying manure within regulatory limits, yet were often applying amounts above crop nutrient needs, indicating that manure is treated as a waste product they need to dispose of, rather than as a valuable fertilizer for crops (Long et al., 2018). Most states regulate CAFO manure applications based on environmental risk or nutrient limits based on crop needs, but these inefficient applications likely occur due to high costs associated with manure hauling (Sims et al., 2005; Centner, 2012), lack of markets due to nutrient ratio variability, as well as presence of pathogens, metals, antibiotics and other undesirable qualities (Ribaudo et al., 2003; Keplinger and Hauck, 2006; Liu et al., 2015; Pepper et al., 2019; Sonne et al., 2019).

[In the UK, in 2021](https://committees.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/39876/pdf/) it was found many operators pay manure brokerage companies to remove the waste as local farms cannot keep up. [Every region in the UK now has more nitrogen than it can absorb](https://www.sustainweb.org/news/jun23-industrial-agriculture-toxic-waste/); regions of England with high concentrations of industrialised indoor-reared livestock have the biggest nitrogen surplus. 40% of total nitrogen comes from livestock manure

There's [far too much phosphorus (P)](https://zenodo.org/records/6598122) from UK livestock waste on agricultural land. Total manure P production alone exceeds the requirement for P by cropland and grassland in the catchment by 45%.

## Artificial fertiliser is often better
- [One paper reports](https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/aa6cd5) that the leakage of nitrogen from organic farms using animal manure is 37% worse than the leakage from conventional farming using artificial fertiliser.
- Manure releases nutrients too slowly, whereas crops need it often immediately for a growth spurt. 
## The Grey water footprint
- See also [[Animal agriculture uses lots of water\|Animal agriculture uses lots of water]]
- [[Citations/Gerbens-leenes et al., 2013\|Gerbens-leenes et al., 2013]] details the grey water footprint of different systems and animals, which is the amount of water required to neutralise pollution. In animals most of this is like manure.

## UK fertiliser demand
from [[Citations/UK governmental food security review, 2024\|UK governmental food security review, 2024]]:

The UK demand for nitrogen is approximately 2 million tonnes and for phosphorus is 250,000 tonnes per annum. Approximately 50% of nitrogen is imported as inorganic fertilisers (or raw materials), and 50% of this is domestically produced via livestock manures. For phosphorus approximately 20% is imported inorganic fertiliser and 70% comes from livestock manures (Defra, 2022)
## Misc
- In the US Methane emissions from dairy manure management more than doubled from 1990 to 2020, thanks to factory farm waste management practices that can release significantly more methane than pasture-based systems [[Citations/Food and water watch, 2023\|Food and water watch, 2023]]
- [A study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652616321953) of Wisconsin dairy farms found that long term storage of manure produced the greatest level of GHG of all farm sizes studied.
