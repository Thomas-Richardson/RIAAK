GFI estimated in 2023 that [[food and meat accounts for a large proportion of greenhouse gas emissions\|Meat contributes ~15% of global GHG]] but alt proteins account for less than 0.5% of climate financing. See also [[Alternative proteins are better for the environment\|Alternative proteins are better for the environment]]

[Plant-based foods provide a 4.4 gigaton (Gt) reduction](https://www.bcg.com/publications/2022/combating-climate-crisis-with-alternative-protein) in CO₂ equivalent (CO₂e) emissions per trillion dollars of investment as compared to 0.4 Gt for vehicles, 0.3 Gt for electricity, and 0.2 Gt for aviation

> [!NOTE] Add a bit about whole plant based foods

There is increasing evidence that eating less and meat and dairy is one of, if not _the_ biggest ways to reduce your impact on climate change. Animal products are responsible for 15% of greenhouse gas emissions, more than the transport sector. No positive diet changes [come remotely close](https://ourworldindata.org/less-meat-or-sustainable-meat) to being as good for the climate as eating less meat and dairy. It might be [impossible to stay under 1.5 degrees](https://www.independent.co.uk/climate-change/news/meat-climate-change-paris-agreement-vegetarian-b1621033.html) of warming without reducing meat. The good news is that plant-based meat alternatives often produce [30-90% less GHG emissions](https://gfi.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/GFI-Plant-Based-Meat-Fact-Sheet_Environmental-Comparison.pdf) than meat does.
