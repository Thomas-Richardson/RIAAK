## Alternative framings
Make meat pay VAT: The UK’s Value Added Tax, or VAT, is meant to target luxury goods while withholding taxes on “staples.” But the definition of what exactly counts as a luxury is a bit mysterious. [Currently beef, lamb, pork, chicken are all excluded from the VAT](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/food-products-and-vat-notice-70114 "Meat products excluded from VAT"). But shelled nuts are considered to be “luxury goods” and have the 20% VAT imposed on them.
