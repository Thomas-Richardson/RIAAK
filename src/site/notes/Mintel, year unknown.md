SE Asian consumers 

5 segments:
- Inert: low income, low interest in PB, lack of knowledge
- Fan: middle to high income, positive, trust health benefits
- sceptics: young, low income, positive, future focussed environmental advocates, price sensitive
- Meatarians , budgets are tight, they want products that have the taste and nutrition of meat. They currently feel PB is poor value. They're adventurous eaters though

55% of Thai consumers believe PB foods are ultraprocessed
