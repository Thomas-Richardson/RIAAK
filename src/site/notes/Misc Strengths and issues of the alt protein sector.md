## Strengths
- There is strong activity across all stakeholders (researchers, governments, startups, industry) in the alternative protein ecosystem.
- There is a good talent pipeline because the work has impact and is challenging.
- Alternative proteins represent the most promising path forward to bridge the protein gap by 2050. Therefore, alternative proteins are not optional; they are essential.

## Challenges
- With limited prospects for new protein options that can scale with increasing consumer demand.
- While options like chickpeas, fava beans, and mung beans are slowly making inroads into the industry, they invariably fall short on either protein content, production cost and yield, or palatability
- The over-dependency on these three ingredients limits product options and growth
- Further, products are manufactured on legacy equipment using processes intended for other purposes developed decades ago.
- The tussle between messaging, highlighting sustainability, and cruelty-free production versus taste and price muddies branding and messaging for companies in the sector
