CAFOs pollute local air with more than just foul odors: they release bacteria, fungi, endotoxins, ammonia, hydrogen sulfide, methane and even antibiotic residue into the air. Local communities breathe all this in.

- In [Mexico](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0264837710000244), there have been resident reports of respiratory health issues due to hog pollution in the Perote Valley area, and [governmental investigations](https://www.hsi.org/wp-content/uploads/assets/pdfs/pig_factory_farming_in_mexico.pdf) found decreased aquifer levels, increased odors, and poor air quality due to swine farms in that region.
- [A study of followed 4M rural Dutch (Sim√µes et al., 2022)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412022000666?via%3Dihub#s0010) between 2005 and 2012 and found that 54.5% lived within 500M of an animal farm, 98.8% within 2KM. Living near pig farms increase mortality risk from Respiratory disease and Pneumonia, being close to dairy farms had no effect and being close to poultry farms but only when they were intensive.
- [A systematic review by Perry (2024)](https://repository.lib.ncsu.edu/server/api/core/bitstreams/04fa7215-e0fb-4fcb-b5a7-4b9d65d8d123/content) of 12 studies between 2015 and 2023 on health outcomes of living near poultry CAFOs finds 9 of them (75%) find negative health effects. 5 of the 8 studies that investigated respiratory problems found negative effects

Nearly all of these were Dairy or beef CAFOs.
- [Baliatsas et al., 2020](https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/17/5/1591) significantly higher prevalence of pneumonia in the total sample in the livestock dense area, which was also observed among susceptible subgroups of children, the elderly, and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Lower respiratory tract infections, respiratory symptoms, vertigo, and depression were also more common in the livestock dense area compared to the control area. In general, there were no significant differences in chronic conditions such as asthma, COPD, or lung cancer.
- [Hooiveld et al, 2015](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://bibliotekanauki.pl/articles/49694.pdf&hl=en&sa=T&oi=gsb-ggp&ct=res&cd=0&d=3710742477687716588&ei=ROaCZpCzGJWx6rQPnaGcgAg&scisig=AFWwaeY6NjvczRgBR9JyD4-yGWhe) found that greater odor annoyance from living near a CAFO, the more participants self reported various symptoms, though they rarely visited their doctor about them.
- A systematic review by [O'Connor et al., 2017](https://systematicreviewsjournal.biomedcentral.com/counter/pdf/10.1186/s13643-017-0465-z.pdf) found no consistent evidence that proximity to farms reduces health.
- [Systematic review](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12940-021-00774-3) shows that CAFOs (and other industrial plants) that give off bad odors can cause headaches, nausea, vomiting and such

## Smells

## Most health effect are respiratory
- [the 2024 poultry review](https://repository.lib.ncsu.edu/server/api/core/bitstreams/04fa7215-e0fb-4fcb-b5a7-4b9d65d8d123/content), 9/12 focussed on respiratory, with 6 of them exclusively studying resp. 
- [This systematic review](https://systematicreviewsjournal.biomedcentral.com/counter/pdf/10.1186/s13643-017-0465-z.pdf) by O'Connor 2017 also mentions that respiratory are the key issues.

## Case Study, North Carolina
In North Carolina, [poorer communities](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/doi/abs/10.1289/ehp.8586&hl=en&sa=T&oi=gsb&ct=res&cd=0&d=12375752278063572808&ei=Mzd9ZtbtF92r6rQPv5O9kAY&scisig=AFWwaeZ_6nYR0P7nP6OuTDfXgNsL) with more people of colour are more likely to be closer to swine CAFOs. They're often [too poor to move](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23003487/north-carolina-hog-pork-bacon-farms-environmental-racism-black-residents-pollution-meat-industry). The state 8.8 million pigs produce 10 billion gallons of waste a year.

## Complications
-  Rural populations have less pollution so generally have lower rates of respiratory disease, which may mask the effect of CAFOs, so looking at CAFOs.
- Studies at 1 point in time might be confounded by the fact that people who have terrible health effects from CAFOs will typically just move away, only leaving those with decent health. This might misleadingly create the impression that there are no negative health effects, when its actually because the study selects for healthier people who can tolerate the effects.
