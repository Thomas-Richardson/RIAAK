- [[food and meat accounts for a large proportion of greenhouse gas emissions\|food and meat accounts for a large proportion of greenhouse gas emissions]]
- [[Animal agriculture is a big source of air pollution\|A flexitarian and vegetarian diet can reduce air pollution]]
- [[Citations/Stehfest et al., 2009\|Stehfest et al., 2009]] estimated that a global move towards low meat diets could reduce the cost of reaching our 2050 climate goals by 50%! And save a ton of land
- [[Citations/Aleksandrowicz et al., 2016\|Aleksandrowicz et al., 2016]] also find that we could reduce GHG by about a third by reducing but not giving up meat.
- A 50% reduction in animal products could halt land degredation by 2050 ([[Citations/Kozicka et al., 2023\|Kozicka et al., 2023]])
