[According to the Mission Motor](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1outCnQHRVHgSMgCEkQWGSHJNNzMq2E_l/view):
- high interest in and perceived need for MEL
- probably greater need for modularised MEL tools rather than building complete systems
- Small data so more qual than quan
- They stopped doing a cohort model because no size fits all

Experts indicate spending between 3 and 20% of a program budget on MEL is deemed adequate for ensuring accountability, assessing effectiveness, and providing opportunities for learning and continuous improvement.
## Why MEL fails
- MEL being complex and overwhelming
- using the wrong tools
- lack of training
- some types of interventions such as lobbying, are hard to measure
- it’s often difficult to quantify the impact
## My thoughts
- Do they want to target high funding, large, but potentially ineffective orgs, because they are the highest leverage for improving MEL?
- Can tiny stats tools improve things as well as qual?
- Can Mission Motor collect org wide data that they share with all orgs to get around small data problem?
