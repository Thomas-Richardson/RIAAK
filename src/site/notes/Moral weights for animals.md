- Our objective: provide “moral weights” for 11 farmed species.
- To make this tractable, we made four assumptions: utilitarianism, hedonism, valence symmetry, and unitarianism.
- Given these assumptions, an animal’s “moral weight” is that animal’s capacity for welfare—the total amount of welfare that the animal _could_ realize.
- Capacity for welfare = welfare range (the difference between the best and worst welfare states the individual can realize at a time) × lifespan.
- Given welfare ranges, we can convert welfare improvements into DALY-equivalents averted, making cross-species cost-effectiveness analyses possible.
