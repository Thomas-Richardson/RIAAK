## Counterpoint: Thailand
That said, 2/3 of consumers in Thailand say they intend to reduce meat in the next 2 years ([[Citations/Madre Brava, 2023\|Madre Brava, 2023]]), a finding mirrored by [Marketbuzzz in 2022 (1000 consumers)](https://www.bangkokpost.com/business/general/2404703/plant-based-meat-innovations-in-demand#:~:text=The%20main%20motivations%20are,or%20to%20lose%20weight), that said, this poll found 14% of the same was vegan which was suspiciously high. [Mintel in 2023](https://www.mintel.com/press-centre/mintel-over-half-of-thai-consumers-are-committed-to-taking-healthy-eating-into-their-own-hands-but-budgets-create-barriers/#:~:text=Over%20half%20of%20Thais,healthily%20but%20budgets%20create) claimed that 24% of Thais wanted to go completed PB. [[Citations/Food Frontier 2023\|Food Frontier 2023]] sa that 44% of Thais claim to have limited their meat intake in 2022.
