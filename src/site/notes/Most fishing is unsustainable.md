In the [2020 FAO State of Fisheries report](http://www.fao.org/state-of-fisheries-aquaculture) where they show 59.6% of fish are "maximally sustainably fished" (likely unsustainable given uncertainty around illegal fishing and monitoring). And 34.2% of "stocks fished at biologically unsustainable levels." That's 93.8% of fish populations that are either exploited at biologically unsustainable levels or removed close to the rate of replacement.

**According to the UN state of the oceans and global assessment** [**reports from IPBES**](https://www.ipbes.net/news/Media-Release-Global-Assessment)**:**

- 33% of fish populations are below 40% historical levels
- 60% of fish populations are between 40% and 60% historical levels
- [Only 7% of fish populations are above 60% historical levels](https://www.ipbes.net/news/ipbes-global-assessment-summary-policymakers-pdf)

According to the Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, [55 percent](https://ipbes.net/global-assessment) of the seafloor is affected by industrial fishing, and [66 percent](https://ipbes.net/global-assessment) of the global marine environment has been altered by human actions.
