### A comprehensive collection of meat reduction research is waiting for researchers, advocates, and funders to unlock its potential

## The scattered science problem

If you’re an advocate, researcher, or funder seeking effective meat reduction interventions, you’ve likely encountered a familiar challenge. The **literature presents a fragmented landscape**: studies scattered across environmental science, medicine, psychology, and animal advocacy research. Academic papers intermix with gray literature from nonprofits and NGOs. Research focuses range from the effectiveness of leaflets to the optimization of menu design and the impacts of educational campaigns.

This fragmentation **creates a significant barrier to evidence synthesis**, and the most dedicated advocates and researchers struggle to get a complete picture of what actually works. While **hundreds of billions of animals are raised in industrial agriculture systems** each year**,** we end up with blind spots, duplicated efforts, and **missed opportunities** to learn from the most effective approaches.

## Introducing a comprehensive database of meat reduction interventions

After identifying and screening over 8,600 unique sources, we recently **released a database containing 413 sources investigating interventions to reduce meat and animal product consumption.** Unlike previous reviews that often had restrictive criteria (focusing only on adults, only randomized trials, or only specific types of interventions), we cast the widest possible net.

This database is different from others previously released on this topic:

- **Minimal restrictions, maximum scope**: We included any intervention designed to reduce meat consumption across any human population, using any study design that could provide useful evidence. While other reviews might focus only on educational interventions or exclude non-randomized studies, we recognized that breakthrough insights often come from unexpected places.
- **Real-world relevance**: We included actual consumption data, self-reported consumption, and even hypothetical choice scenarios. Some databases exclude choice architecture studies that occur in campus cafeterias or grocery stores because they’re not randomized controlled trials—but these natural experiments may have greater external validity than lab studies.
- **Gray literature**: A significant portion of meat reduction research is conducted outside traditional academic journals, often published by nonprofits and advocacy organizations. We ensured that we captured this often-overlooked evidence.

## What you can do with this database

The database represents a foundation for future research. The systematic screening work has been completed, but significant analytical opportunities remain.

## Complete the coding work

We developed a detailed **framework for extracting key information from each source**; however, we were unable to complete the coding due to resource constraints. This creates a valuable opportunity for researchers to build upon our systematic foundation.

Doing so, they could filter through subsets of the data and answer questions such as:

- Which types of interventions show the strongest effects across different populations?
- How do educational approaches compare to choice architecture changes?
- What factors predict whether an intervention will have lasting effects?
- Which studies have the strongest methodological designs for testing causality?

## Conduct targeted literature reviews

The database opens up possibilities for focused meta-analyses and systematic reviews on specific intervention types. We had originally planned reviews on classroom interventions, increasing the availability of plant-based options, and menu design—but additional research directions could extend well beyond our initial scope.

## Build on existing work that draws on our database

The database has already proven valuable—two research teams used our database as a foundation for their own analyses.

- Green and co-authors (2024) conducted a [meta-analysis](https://osf.io/preprints/osf/q6xyr_v4) that revealed existing interventions have quite small effects, concluding that meaningfully reducing meat consumption remains “an unsolved problem.”
- Sleegers and co-authors (2025) built the [Library of Interventions for Meat Elimination (LIME)](https://meat-lime.vercel.app/), an interactive platform that lets users explore studies and calculate meta-analytic effect sizes.

## Next steps

The [database](https://osf.io/jp498) and [codebook](https://osf.io/4dx7h) are freely available on the Open Science Framework at [osf.io/dnu58](https://osf.io/dnu58/). Many sources are open access, and for those that aren’t, we’ve provided stable links that can often be accessed through academic libraries.

If you have questions about this work, you can reach out to [Jacob Peacock](https://rpstrategicanimalinsights.substack.com/p/), who coordinated the project from its inception.

Whether you’re a researcher planning your next study, an advocate designing a campaign, or a funder evaluating grant applications, this database offers an unprecedented foundation for evidence-based meat reduction decision-making.
