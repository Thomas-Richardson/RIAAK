The [Cambridge Declaration On Consciousness](http://fcmconference.org/img/CambridgeDeclarationOnConsciousness.pdf) says it is extremely likely.


According to [Griffin and Speck (2004)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10071-003-0203-x):

- Animal responses to novel challenges suggest a versatility which implies conscious thinking, and  
- Reports on animal communication show evidence for animals having subjective experiences.
