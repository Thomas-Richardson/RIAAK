#animal_advocacy 

- They need to be fed 3x their weight in fish to raise and they're picky eaters
- farmed Salmon must be fed 120 wild caught anchovies.
- They don't breed in captivity and we don't know how
- It's not conservation because currently we don't have a closed breeding cycle so have to take juveniles from the wild
- 50% die whilst being raised, 30% is cannibalism
- They take 1 or 2 years to 
- Octopus are solitary animals so suffer greatly 
- no approved humane slaughter method for octopi. Their physiology is so alien, and we don't understand them, so we have no idea. Their brain isn't even in 1 place! You can't just bolt gun them to the head because you can't get a hold of them and their brain isnt entirely in their head 

## Carnivorous fish 
- tuna
- salmon
- pike

## Is meat a source of vital nutrients?
- Technically yes, but most foods are. An apple is a source of nutrients.
- People use this statement to imply something very different
- indeed it is indisputably proven that you do not need meat to get all vital nutrients. If you supplement B12 or eat foods fortified with B12 like plant milks, then it's also true that you do not need any animal products to get all vital nutrients.
