- 34 environmental NGOs based in the U.S., Canada, and Sweden. The researchers conducted extensive interviews with staff members on the issue of meat consumption and climate change and noted that the majority of the people they talked to did view high levels of meat consumption as problematic. Yet, most of the NGO staff admitted meat was _not_ on their organizationâ€™s agenda, and certainly not a priority.[^1]
- Faunalytics study[^2] reviewed the 100 most recent climate articles (as of September 2022) published by 10 national outlets, including the New York Times and Wall Street Journal. Out of 1,000 articles, just 7 percent mention animal agriculture and, within that coverage, much of the reporting covers climate impacts on livestock rather than how meat production is a source of greenhouse gas emissions.
