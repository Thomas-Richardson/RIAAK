#factory_farming 

- [[Awareness of factory farming\|Awareness of factory farming]]

Global web searches on the topic of “intensive animal farming” (which includes search terms like “factory farming”) have stayed constant relative to other searches over the last two decades.

Why is factory farming so rarely publicly discussed? Some blame industry capture of the media. But the industry struggles to get news coverage too. The US chicken industry’s main communications initiative, [Chicken Check-In](https://www.chickencheck.in/), appears to have never secured a story in a mainstream news outlet or many “likes” on its [social](https://www.instagram.com/chickencheck.in/) [media](https://x.com/chickencheckin) posts. The problem is not media bias, but media indifference.
