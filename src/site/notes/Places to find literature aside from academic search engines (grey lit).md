If you're not finding what you need in RIAAK, there are some other curated sources of material 
## These places will often contain research that is not indexed by google scholar
- [ ] Faunalytics: While their [original studies](https://faunalytics.org/completed-projects/) are all indexed by academic search engines, and their [Research library](https://faunalytics.org/?s=&post_type=post&orderby=post_date&order=desc&explore=true) mostly contains accessible summaries of published papers, it does also cover reports, whitepapers and other scholarship, so worth a search.
- [ ] [Rethink priorities](https://rethinkpriorities.org/animal-welfare): sometimes, but not usually indexed by Google Scholar
- [ ] [Food systems research fund](https://www.fsrfund.org/funded-research): some, but not all projects end up published in academic journals 
- [ ] [Animal Ask](https://www.animalask.org/research) are currently not indexed by academic search engines, but I have told them about this and so this may be fixed at some point
- [ ] [Ambitious Impact (formerly Charity Entrepreneurship)](https://www.charityentrepreneurship.com/animal-welfare-reports) publish their [research reports](https://www.charityentrepreneurship.com/animal-welfare-reports)
	- I have been told that they don't publish everything, so if you're wanting to be extra thorough (or are really desperate for references) you could email them.
- [ ] The [EA forum](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/?tab=animal-welfare) contains high quality writing.
- [ ] Tiny Beam [Fellowship winners](https://tinybeamfund.org/Fellowship-Awards) are sometimes missed by Google Scholar
- [ ] Animal charity evaluators' [Reports](https://animalcharityevaluators.org/research/reports/) are often novel scholarship
- [ ] Of course [Bryant Research](https://bryantresearch.co.uk/insights/)!
- [ ] [Open Phil](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/research-reports/?q=&focus-area%5B%5D=farm-animal-welfare) Don't post that often but when they post it's good stuff
- [ ] [The Good Growth Co](https://www.goodgrowth.io/#research-highlights) for research in Asia
- [ ] [North Mountain Consulting](https://www.northmountainconsulting.com/projects) are an alt-protein consultancy
- [ ] [Food Frontiers](https://www.foodfrontier.org/resources/) is a non profit alt protein think tank
- [ ] Mintel is a leading market research company. Most reports cost $ but there are some for free here: https://www.mintel.com/insights/downloads
- [ ] YouGov is a leading polling company. Like Mintel they often charge for their reports but you can often find polling for free [here](https://yougov.co.uk/). You can also find more detailed reports if YouGov did them on behalf of a client that chose to make the results free, as [Compassion in World Farming](https://commercial.yougov.com/rs/464-VHH-988/images/World-framing-results) did here. I have no systematic way to find these reports, if you do, let me know! Sometimes googling "YouGov" AND "what you're interested in" works.
- [ ] [Compassion in world farming](https://www.ciwf.org.uk/research/) release new reports every year, often in depth 
- [ ] [Issue lab](https://search.issuelab.org/1?doctype=&issue_area[0]=health&issue_area[1]=agriculture_and_food&issue_area[2]=animal_welfare&wikitopic_categories=&keywords=&language=&pubdate_start_year=*&pubdate_end_year=*&sort=&categories=&offset=0&pageSize=12&pubdate_start_month=*&pubdate_start_day=*&pubdate_end_month=*&pubdate_end_day=*) aren't only animals but they do stuff on food and animal welfare

## Curated databases of papers
- Animal charity evaluators' [Research Briefs](https://animalcharityevaluators.org/research/research-briefs/) are reviews of existing evidence
- Faunalytics [Research library](https://faunalytics.org/?s=&post_type=post&orderby=post_date&order=desc&explore=true) 
- https://animaldataproject.org/
- [[Citations/Meat and masculinity literature review spreadsheet\|Meat and masculinity literature review spreadsheet]] A sheet of sources for the Bryant project on Meat and Masculinity
- [This is a google sheet that Chris uses for projects. Ideally we'll move it all into RIAAK at some point, but for now its here.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y5p0JS9ybq5qJrXBnj78-6-jOc9wkeRm58tCI-EhP9Y/edit#gid=1570282612)
