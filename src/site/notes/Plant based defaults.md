## In restaurants
- Having a vegan burrito with the option to add meat was the best strategy [in this study](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/jasp.12632).

# Practical factors for when defaults work well:
- The diner base is more progressive/flexitarian
- Culinary teams are already fairly well-versed in plant-based cuisine
- People pay per item, so the base dish can be fully plant-based and meat/dairy can be added on for an extra charge. This works particularly well in corporate cafeterias where meals are partially but not fully subsidized, such that the base plant-based dish is subsidized and people pay the true cost for adding meat.
- The station is serving entrees that are made to order and thus easily customizable, such as bowls and wraps
- The station features international cuisines that are naturally plant-forward
- The station only offers a single entree

For catering menus, defaults are rarely applicable. The most common strategies are ratios, meat reduction, prime placement, subtle substitutions, and tasty titles.
