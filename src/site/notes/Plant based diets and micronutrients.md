- [Nutritionfacts video](https://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-soy-milk-the-most-nutritious-non-dairy-milk/) arguing (halfway through) that the concept of anti-nutrients is misleading. Sure, these compounds in isolation can have anti-nutrient properties, but we rarely consume enough of them that it is likely to have a clinical effect. Generally, studies do not tend to find significant negative effects of plant foods that contain anti-nutrients. Many of these plant foods, like legumes, contain many other chemicals as well that may simply cancel out the anti-nutrients. There's also some evidence that things thought of as anti-nutrients, like phytates, are actually beneficial for your health because they can inhibit things like cancer.
