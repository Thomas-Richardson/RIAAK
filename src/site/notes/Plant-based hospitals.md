- The American College of Cardiology describes hospitalisation as a ‘teachable moment’ for patients as healthcare professionals can inform them about the benefits of a nutritious diet in aiding recovery.
- Most patients assume that hospital food is nutritious, but it actually often isn't.
- This study[^1] outlines arguments for legally requiring plant based options in hospitals
- Nutritional interventions in worksite cafeterias have been found to promote healthier food purchases, decrease unhealthier food sales, and increase revenue[^2] [^3] [^4]
## Advice for implementing
- [[Citations/Aggarwal et al., 2020\|Aggarwal et al., 2020]] and [[Citations/Saldivar et al., 2022\|Saldivar et al., 2022]] both highlight the importance of having the plant-based menu as part of their admission orders so ordering physicians are automatically obligated to bring diet into their admission conversation.  
## Case studies 
[Hospital in Beirut becomes the first in the world to exclusively serve vegan meals](https://www.veganfoodandliving.com/news/hospital-beirut-first-only-vegan-meals/) in 2021. Hayek Hospital [wrote](https://www.greenqueen.com.hk/worlds-first-vegan-hospital-lebanons-hayek-centre-becomes-first-to-serve-only-plant-based-food/): “When the World Health Organization classifies processed meat as Group 1A carcinogenic (causes cancer) same group as tobacco, and red meat as Group 2A carcinogenic, then serving meat in a hospital is like serving cigarettes in a hospital. “Our patients will no longer wake up from surgery to be greeted with ham, cheese, milk, and eggs… the very food that may have contributed to their health problems in the first place.

In 2022, Eric Adams made all 11 hospitals in NYC [PB by default](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/31/climate/new-york-hospitals-vegan-meals.html?searchResultPosition=1). a year after it made those sweeping changes, the hospital system has reduced its food-related carbon emissions by 36 percent, [according to the mayor’s office](https://www.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/263-23/mayor-adams-commits-reducing-city-s-food-based-emissions-33-percent-2030-after-releasing#/0). Nine times out of 10, patients accepted the dishes, and that the satisfaction rate was above 90 percent. There was an initial cost savings of 59 cents per tray

in 2018, the State of California mandated the availability of plant-based meals for hospital patients, as well as for inmates in state prisons. 

Mertens et al., 2023[^5] found that among 45 Dutch speaking hospitals in Belgium, 

King's college London Hospital interviewed over 100 patients about their opinions on removing red and processed meat in hospitals ([[Citations/Truman et al., 2023\|Truman et al., 2023]]). They found that the majority were in favour and did not care about eating red and processed meat while in hospital. However the vast majority preferred to have it replaced with chicken or fish rather than plant based foods.

[[Citations/Saldivar et al., 2022\|Saldivar et al., 2022]] introduced a fully plant based alternative menu for everyone at University of Florida hospital, and while they found that costs could be 30% higher, they reported strong buy-in from patients and staff

## NYC Health + Hospitals/Bellevue
#case_study 
A pilot outpatient program where patients work with a tveam of physicians, a dietitian, and a health coach to transition to a whole-foods, plant-based diet, increase physical activity, and learn stress-management techniques and sleep hygiene.

In the first 3 months since the program launched, early clinical successes include significant reductions in glycosylated hemoglobin, lipids, and body weight. Patients have also reported improved energy, sleep, and motivation to cook healthy meals at home. Anecdotally, patient satisfaction is high. At the time of writing it was undergoing formal review

## Kaiser Permanente
In 2003, Kaiser Permanente launched its first farmers market to re-introduce the concept of food as medicine. Today, the Kaiser Permanente network in Southern California boasts over 50 hospital- and clinic-related farmers markets. Locally, Kaiser Permanente Riverside Medical Center has removed sugar-sweetened beverages and deep fryers from its medical center and offers vegan and vegetarian options for inpatient and outpatient eating selections, along with daily healthy choices, salad bars, and a variety of fruits.

## Montefiore Health System
At Montefiore Health System in the Bronx, NY, the Cardiology Division has a plant-based prevention clinic that offers routine medical care in conjunction with intensive preventive counseling. As part of this initiative, the division offers free 4–5-hour long sessions on Saturday mornings, where a physician and a registered dietitian review plant-based nutrition in detail. The division encourages patients to come to the session with a friend or significant other who can support them in making this lifestyle change. In addition, at the meetings patients receive a plant-based meal, which is often the patients’ first introduction to plant-based foods. Montefiore also has a “Meatless Monday” option in their outpatient cafeterias.
