- The American College of Cardiology describes hospitalisation as a ‘teachable moment’ for patients as healthcare professionals can inform them about the benefits of a nutritious diet in aiding recovery.
- Most patients assume that hospital food is nutritious, but it actually often isn't.
- This study[^1] outlines arguments for legally requiring plant based options in hospitals
- Nutritional interventions in worksite cafeterias have been found to promote healthier food purchases, decrease unhealthier food sales, and increase revenue[^2] [^3] [^4]
## Advice for implementing
- [[Citations/Aggarwal et al., 2020\|Aggarwal et al., 2020]] and [[Citations/Saldivar et al., 2022\|Saldivar et al., 2022]] both highlight the importance of having the plant-based menu as part of their admission orders so ordering physicians are automatically obligated to bring diet into their admission conversation.  
## Case studies 
[Hospital in Beirut becomes the first in the world to exclusively serve vegan meals](https://www.veganfoodandliving.com/news/hospital-beirut-first-only-vegan-meals/) in 2021. Hayek Hospital [wrote](https://www.greenqueen.com.hk/worlds-first-vegan-hospital-lebanons-hayek-centre-becomes-first-to-serve-only-plant-based-food/): “When the World Health Organization classifies processed meat as Group 1A carcinogenic (causes cancer) same group as tobacco, and red meat as Group 2A carcinogenic, then serving meat in a hospital is like serving cigarettes in a hospital. “Our patients will no longer wake up from surgery to be greeted with ham, cheese, milk, and eggs… the very food that may have contributed to their health problems in the first place.

In 2022, Eric Adams made all 11 hospitals in NYC [PB by default](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/31/climate/new-york-hospitals-vegan-meals.html?searchResultPosition=1). a year after it made those sweeping changes, the hospital system has reduced its food-related carbon emissions by 36 percent, [according to the mayor’s office](https://www.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/263-23/mayor-adams-commits-reducing-city-s-food-based-emissions-33-percent-2030-after-releasing#/0). Nine times out of 10, patients accepted the dishes, and that the satisfaction rate was above 90 percent. There was an initial cost savings of 59 cents per tray

in 2018, the State of California mandated the availability of plant-based meals for hospital patients, as well as for inmates in state prisons. 

Mertens et al., 2023[^5] found that among 45 Dutch speaking hospitals in Belgium, 

King's college London Hospital interviewed over 100 patients about their opinions on removing red and processed meat in hospitals ([[Citations/Truman et al., 2023\|Truman et al., 2023]]). They found that the majority were in favour and did not care about eating red and processed meat while in hospital. However the vast majority preferred to have it replaced with chicken or fish rather than plant based foods.

[[Citations/Saldivar et al., 2022\|Saldivar et al., 2022]] introduced a fully plant based alternative menu for everyone at University of Florida hospital, and while they found that costs could be 30% higher, they reported strong buy-in from patients and staff

## Abstract
Poor dietary quality is a leading contributor to mortality in the United States, and to most cardiovascular risk factors. By providing education on lifestyle changes and, specifically, dietary changes, hospitals have the opportunity to use the patient experience as a “teachable moment.” The food options provided to inpatients and outpatients can be a paradigm for patients to follow upon discharge from the hospital. There are hospitals in the United States that are showcasing novel ways to increase awareness of optimal dietary patterns and can serve as a model for hospitals nationwide.

# Notes
*   Poor dietary quality is the leading contributor to premature mortality in the United States, with dietary patterns low in plant-foods being a primary factor.
*   The report emphasizes that dietary patterns focusing on plant-based foods, as opposed to animal-derived products, are associated with significant reductions in cardiovascular risk.
*   In 2017, the American Medical Association (AMA) called on U.S. hospitals to improve patient, staff, and visitor health by providing plant-based meals and eliminating processed meats from menus.
*   The American College of Cardiology (ACC) has put forth similar standards, adding that plant-based meals should be actively offered and promoted within hospital settings.
*   Legislative action is supporting this shift; in 2018, California mandated the availability of plant-based meals for hospital patients.
*   The paper showcases several hospitals that have successfully implemented healthful nutrition programs by offering separate, 100% plant-based menus for inpatients.
*   Pioneering institutions mentioned include the University of Florida's Shands Hospital, Montefiore Health System (Bronx, NY), Northwell's Lenox Hill Hospital (New York, NY), and the Tampa Veterans Administration (VA) hospital.
*   Many hospitals are also introducing plant-forward options in outpatient settings and cafeterias, with programs like "Meatless Monday" being implemented at Montefiore and NYC Health + Hospitals/Bellevue.
*   These initiatives extend beyond menus to include educational programs, such as outpatient lifestyle medicine clinics, cooking classes, and partnerships with local farmers markets (e.g., Kaiser Permanente).
*   The report includes sample plant-based menus from hospitals, featuring dishes such as Tofu Scramble, Black Bean Burgers, Lentil Bolognese, and Tofu Vegetable Stir Fry as replacements for traditional meat-based options.
*   The core argument is that hospitals can use a patient's stay as a "teachable moment" to introduce and model healthful dietary changes that patients can continue after discharge.
