#policy 

All party parliamentary groups are a bit too much admin without effort. You're getting together people who agree on something to talk about how much you agree on something. You organise a lot of meetings, hope MPs attend and if they don't, you have to organise more meetings so that you meet you min meeting quota for being a group.
