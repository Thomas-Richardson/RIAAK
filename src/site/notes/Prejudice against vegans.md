[Adamczyk and Maison 2023](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00224545.2022.2136564#d1e392) is a study of 800 Polish adults found that men were perceived as less competent in a job role if they were described as vegan. Women were not. Neither were perceived as more or less warm. There was no effect of veganism on judgements of suitability for a job or willingness to hire.


[[MacInnis & Hodson, (2017)\|MacInnis & Hodson, (2017)]]
vegetarians and vegans were evaluated equivalently to immigrants, asexuals, and atheists, and significantly more negatively than Blacks. Vegetarians were evaluated equivalently to homosexuals, whereas vegans were evaluated more negatively than homosexuals. Strikingly, only drug addicts were evaluated more negatively than vegetarians and vegans. In terms of discrimination, however, omnivores did not indicate any less willingness to hire or rent to vegetarians or vegans relative to other groups.
