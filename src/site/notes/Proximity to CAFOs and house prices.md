They reduce home values, with properties within 3 miles of a CAFO losing up to 25% of their value. The only facility type that hurts housing prices more [are landfills](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-8276.2005.00724.x), with [Kuethe and Keeney, 2002](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://le.uwpress.org/content/88/2/241.short&hl=en&sa=T&oi=gsb&ct=res&cd=0&d=16728187708642881385&ei=Nqt-Zu-BPI3A6rQPtueGyA4&scisig=AFWwaeb6fiawPfhErcdrVVpHl8hw) finding that the effect of a CAFO on house prices are comparable to industrial waste, solid waste or septic waste facilities.

## Complications
It's not great to simply correlate distance from a CAFO with house values:
- Reverse causality: CAFOs may be intentionally built near low value houses, because that land is not desireable so easier to get planning permission or because the residents are poor and have little power to resist.
