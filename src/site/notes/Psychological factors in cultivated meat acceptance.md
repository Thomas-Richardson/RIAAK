[Bryant et al.,](https://osf.io/fmxwn)  Found that among US: meat attachment makes you less accepting of pb meat but not cultivated meat, good sign. Also meat eaters were more favourable to cultivated meat. 
Disgust was a significant predictor of plant-based and clean meat acceptance, a finding which was unique to the USA, not the case among educated indians and chinese. Chinese women were more likely to accept clean meat. India had lower levels of meat attachment than China. Lower food neophobia and higher familiarity predicted acceptance of both plant based and clean meat in every country. With regard to plantbased meat, omnivores and those who eat more meat are again more likely to eat plantbased meat. Higher income groups in India expressed more interest in plantbased meat, as did more educated and more liberal consumers. Overall, demographics, food neophobia and familiarity as well as diet predicted like 50% of the variance in clean meat acceptance.

##Â Speculation
People don't respond well to 'wow this is cool technology' arguments. We need to target disgust.
