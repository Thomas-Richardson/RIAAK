## Quiet Activism

Exploring the barriers and facilitators to animal activism

November 2022

> “ This paper focuses on the relationship between individuals and animal activism. Due to the scarcity of literature on the topic, indirect indicators were used to gain a preliminary understanding of the barriers and facilitators of animal activism, categorising barriers into internal and external barriers. – Euan Ross

## Background

Defining animal activism can be difficult. Broadly, animal activists believe animals deserve to live happy, cruelty-free lives. However, what constitutes ‘activism’ can be more contentious. Dietary change in and of itself may be considered activism but others may only consider more direct forms of action  
like participating in animal rescues. While all forms of animal activism are important, this paper will focus on activism that seeks to change others’ behaviours, especially through ‘quieter’ forms.

This paper focuses on the **relationship between individuals and animal activism.** Due to the scarcity of literature on the topic, indirect indicators were used to gain a preliminary understanding of the barriers and facilitators of animal activism, categorising barriers into internal and external barriers

## Findings

A survey of 1,000 individuals living in the UK was carried out. It found that participation in animal activism is very low; however, most individuals were not wholly resistant to it. Rather, most participants either had not considered it before or would like to get involved. To this end, individuals were most willing to engage in ‘quiet’ forms of activism such as charity and social activism, whereas, frontline activism garnered less support.

Overall, internal barriers, such as self-limiting beliefs, were more commonly experienced than external barriers. However, some external barriers like not having enough time were also commonly experienced.

Accordingly, the most popular facilitators to animal activism engagement resolved these barriers, such as having more time or having activism work they are comfortable with. A focus group and an interview were subsequently carried out to deconstruct the reasons behind these findings. It was found that internal barriers often exacerbate external barriers. For example, not feeling confident enough may worsen social pressures.

**Participants found it easiest to engage with activism when using ‘quiet’ activism methods such as volunteering or donating to charities, rather than ‘loud’ methods such as frontline or online activism. They also preferred working towards pre-established goals or projects such as promoting Veganuary.**

## Impact & Recommendations

- People often associate animal activism with frontline activism, but are **generally far more receptive to engaging in forms of ‘quieter’ activism** that more aptly meet their skillset. Stressing the importance of these quiet forms of activism could greatly increase participation rates.
- This could be **effectively done with national campaigns**. Individuals stressed the ease of using a campaign such as Veganuary to engage others about the topic in a more casual manner. These campaigns could promote trying to get friends and families to sign up together.
- The same is true of charity activism; individuals find it easier to engage in activism when it is with the backing of a locally or nationally recognised charity.
- The most prevalent barriers to activism are internal barriers, such as perceived lack of knowledge or confidence. Providing **structured training and certification** could provide a tangible way to overcome these internal barriers.
- Those that eat meat feel like it is a barrier to getting involved in the animal advocacy movement, even if they are in the process of reducing their meat consumption. The animal activism movement should **try to present an image that is welcoming to these individuals**, and promote forms of activism which are accessible to them, such as charity volunteering and donations.
- The animal activism movement may benefit, and gain more activists, if it has **very clearly defined goals and reasons for them**, as well as tangible smaller objectives. This will help people to have a clear direction and confidence when participating in animal activism.
