# How did you make this?
This is my Obsidian.md vault published as a static site using Netlify and Github site.
# Why did you do this?
I have 7 key values in my life, and one of those is “creation”. I'm a big fan of creating and sharing anything that others might find useful. Given that I'm making all these notes and doing all this writing anyway, I might as well share it! This format allows me to share value with you, with almost no extra effort from me.

It's a key part of my job to grapple with the vast literature in the animal advocacy spaces. And being a [personal knowledge management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_management) nerd, I am obsessed with finding the best way to store and retrieve the vast amounts of information we have to deal with in the 21st century. I think this makes me well-placed to create a valuable resource for the animal advocacy community.
# Why are some of the notes incomplete, rough, or generally shitty?
I am actively developing this knowledge base over time. Notes will likely improve. New notes are added all the time, old ones are improved, and some may even be combined or deleted.
# Why don't all the links work?
Links that don't work are not broken, they simply lead to somewhere else in my vault that I have decided not to put on the site for you to see. Some things are private, like client info. If you think a private link should not be, let me know. If you see a link you think should be private, definitely let me know.
# Why don't you use folders like a normal person?
Have you ever found yourself trying to find the 'right' folder for a note or document, only to realise there are 2 or more folders that would be a good home for it? Which do you choose? Do you find yourself spending hours coming up with an 'optimal' folder structure so you can find stuff later? Only to have to redesign the whole thing when you add a bunch more documents? 

Tags are basically a better version of folders. While they are less intuitive at first, they are very powerful. A note can have as many tags as you like, allowing you to find that note by searching for any of it's tags. 
# Why is the structure a bit strange?
These notes are just a subset of my own personal [Obsidian Vault](https://obsidian.md/) whose structure has been optimised for my work. They are pushed from my vault to the internet with no changes.
