This is the homepage for Richie's Impactful Animal Advocacy Knowledgebase, aka RIAAK!

Here I publish my notes on Animal Advocacy. Feel free to use them for your own work.

These notes are optimised to be useful to me in my role as the Director of Research at [Bryant Research](https://bryantresearch.co.uk/). As such, they are a combination of:
- Brief summaries of useful studies (usually found in the Citations folder). Reviews, big reports, or useful single studies. 
	- I add studies when they become useful to me. The goal is not to add every animal advo study ever. It's to curate a list based on themes (e.g. plant based initiatives in hospital) or high quality evidence (meta analyses)
- Micro-content I have written to help me quickly put together reports for clients.

## How to use RIAAK
There are 6 ways you can navigate RIAAK:

1. Use the search bar on the left
2. Use Links
3. Use Local Graphs
4. Use the Global Graph
5. Use Tags
6. Use Folders

## The search bar
- Probably the easiest way to search RIAAK
- Annoyingly it can only currently do exact word search, so if you search "alternative proteins healthier" it probably won't surface an article called "vegan meat is good for you".
- I'd advise just putting in a bunch of keywords you're interested in and see what it turns up

## Links
- This knowledge base is organised a bit like Wikipedia: pages are connected by links.
- You can surf RIAAK by clicking through the links on a given page. [[Red and processed meat are bad for you\|Try clicking this one]]
- If you hover your mouse over the link, it will show you a preview.
- At the bottom of each page, you will see a list of all the other pages that link to it.

## Local graph
- Side note: confusingly, Obsidian, and the computer scientists that made it, use the term "graph" specifically to refer to these networks of dots connected by lines.
- Whenever you are on a note, you'll notice a small network graph on the right-hand side under the heading “interactive graph”. This visualises the note you're looking at as well as all the notes connected to it through links. 
- If you click any of these nodes you'll go straight to them! You can thus “surf” the web of notes in this knowledge base and learn all sorts of interesting things.
- If you want to see the local graph larger, then click the arrow in the top right of the graph

## Global Graph
- If every file in RIAAK is linked to other files, can we visualise the *entirety* of RIAAK as a network graph? Yes we can! 
- This is called a Global Graph, and you do that by clicking the icon on the top right of any local graph that looks like 3 circles
- Hover over a note and it will highlight all notes it's linked to.

## Tags
- Tags are those hashtags you see on notes, usually at the top. They are the topics that a note is about. 
- If you click on a tag, it will show you all notes in RIAAK with that tag. Try it out! #bryant_research        #farming        #health_disease  
- Tags are a great way of delving into a high level topic: "What do we have on **meat alternatives**?"
- If you have suggestions for tags that you expected to find or would find useful, let me know!
- [[Citations/RIAK tag (topic) list\|A list of all tags in RIAAK can be found here]]
- [[RIAAK FAQ#Why don't you use folders like a normal person?\|An explainer of why I use these rather than folders]]

## Folders
On the left side, you will also see the main folders and all the files inside them. Not a great way to search for a file, but might be useful.
