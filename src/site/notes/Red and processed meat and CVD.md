the consumption of red and processed meat has also been associated with increased rates of coronary heart disease[^2] (only found for processed meat)[^7]

## Risk ratios for red and processed meat and CVD
[[Citations/Kwok et al., 2019\|Kwok et al., 2019]] combined the results of 17 reviews (!) on the link between various food groups and CVD mortality. They found that Red meat showed a RR for CVD of 1.15 (1.05,1.26, 6 studies) per 100g eaten a day and processed meats (RR 1.24, 1.09-1.4, 6 studies) per 50g eaten a day.
