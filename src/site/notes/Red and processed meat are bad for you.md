between 2010 and 2021, the global health burden linked to red meat nearly doubled, rising by about 44%.

 In addition to being linked with cancer, stroke[^3], type 2 diabetes mellitus[^4][^7], and overall mortality[^5][^6] (see also [[Citations/Schwingshackl et al., 2017a\|Schwingshackl et al., 2017a]] for best evidence).

[[Citations/Neuenschwander et al., 2023\|Neuenschwander et al., 2023]] finds a bunch of great health effects of swapping red and processed meat for nuts, legumes, whole grains etc.
## Why is processed meat worse?
- [[Why does red and processed meat cause cancer (q)\|Why does red and processed meat cause cancer (q)]]
- [^7] processed red meat has 400% of the sodium and that accounted for 2/3 of difference 

## Red and processed meat health effects are sometimes, but not always linear
The dose-response between processed meat and cancer mortality is linear, but non linear for CVD ([[Citations/Wang et al., 2016\|Wang et al., 2016]])
