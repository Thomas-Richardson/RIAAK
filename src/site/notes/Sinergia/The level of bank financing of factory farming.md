**A [Feedback report](https://feedbackglobal.org/butchering-the-planet/) published in July 2020 took a wider look at the financing of animal agriculture, showing that $478 billion had been given to meat and dairy companies by more than 2,500 investment banks, firms, and pension funds around the globe from 2015 to 2020. By comparison, just $59 billion in backing was received by alternative protein producers over the same period, according to the [Good Food Institute](https://gfi.org/blog/2020-state-of-the-industry-highlights/).**
