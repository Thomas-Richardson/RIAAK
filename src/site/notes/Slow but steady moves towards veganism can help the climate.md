> A 50% reduction in animal products could entirely halt deforestation and degredation of the environment by 2050

Plant-based animal product alternatives are increasingly promoted to achieve more sustainable diets. Here, <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">we use a global economic land use model</mark> to assess the food system-wide impacts of a global dietary shift towards these alternatives. We find <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">a substantial reduction in the global environmental impacts by 2050 if globally 50% of the main animal products (pork, chicken, beef and milk) are substituted—net reduction of forest and natural land is almost fully halted and agriculture and land use GHG emissions decline by 31% in 2050 compared to 2020.</mark> 

<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">If spared agricultural land within forest ecosystems is restored to forest, climate benefits could double</mark>, reaching 92% of the previously estimated land sector mitigation potential. Furthermore, the restored area could contribute to 13-25% of the estimated global land restoration needs under target 2 from the Kunming Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework by 2030, and <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">future declines in ecosystem integrity by 2050 would be more than halved</mark>. The distribution of these impacts varies across regions—the main impacts on agricultural input use are in China and on environmental outcomes in Sub-Saharan Africa and South America. While beef replacement provides the largest impacts, substituting multiple products is synergistic.

Replacing 50% of meat and milk products with plant-based alternatives by 2050 can reduce agriculture and land use relatedgreenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 31% and halt the degradation of forest and natural land,
