- Many of the tools are very expensive, so be sure you know what you need them for before you pay up.
- Check what social media sites the tool can do: some of the most popular ones cannot examine facebook or instagram for example, and primary look at Twitter.
- DO Check how far back the tools can search. We were dismayed to find that TalkWalker can only search the last 30 days of content.
- Understand the "search syntax" of the tool you're using. For example, in TalkWalker you can use boolean search, e.g. "Meat" AND "cholesterol" returns contents featuring both of these terms. Or "Vegan" AND ("healthy" OR "environment" OR "kindness") returns mentions of vegan and one of those terms. I understand that no one wants to read technical documentation but its vitla to unlock the power of these tools and avoid making mistakes. 
- Do take an iterative approach. Search for terms, examine what content pops up and then refine terms. Sometimes a term has few hits because it isn't really used in discussions, and you should find the right term that people are using. Other times it's because the conversations you are looking for aren't really online.
