#research_methods

Social listening is where you monitor social media to see what people are saying about a brand or topic. This can include:
## finding data
"It's not about the number of users but how representative an opinion is. It could be one post that says "I don't eat meat because xyz" and if it goes viral it's a significant data point. But the number of RTs or likes isn't the only thing - that's relative too. Not all communities react in similar numbers as others, so you have to then look into the community and get a sense of the way they consume social media posts and re-evaluate. Or sometimes it could be a post that's not very popular but is expressing something the local culture tends to not express loudly, so even a few posts could be significant. Or it could be the timing that matters (maybe the volume goes up at one time compared to others, and that tells you something, not the performanceÂ of any single post). We don't control what's out there, so you have to go wherever it takes you."
