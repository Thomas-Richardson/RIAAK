## Nutrition-sensitive agriculture
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Nutrition-sensitive agriculture (NSA)</mark> is an approach championed by the [world bank](https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/agriculture/brief/food-security-update/what-is-food-security) to agricultural development that prioritizes the production and consumption of nutritionally rich foods, aiming to address malnutrition and micronutrient deficiencies.
## Enhanced homestead food production (EHFP)
- Enhanced homestead food production (EHFP) is a series of programs in many countries pioneered by Helen Keller International (HKI). 
- These programs are designed to improve maternal and child health and nutrition outcomes through a combination of home agricultural production activities and behavior change communication (BCC) strategies. HKI's EHFP programs target women and aim to increase access to micronutrient-rich foods, enhance income through the sale of surplus goods, and provide health and nutrition-related education.
- They include animal products
## Supplementation
- At least 2 high-dose Vit A capsules per year can be sufficient; Hellen Keller does this.
- The global solution to addressing deficiency has been through Universal Salt Iodization (USI) programs.
