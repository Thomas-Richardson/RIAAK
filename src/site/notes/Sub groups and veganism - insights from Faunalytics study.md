- Our study found that men ages 18-24 were most open to voting for ballot measures or signing petitions aimed at improving farmed animal welfare. The next most popular action with young men was support for Meatless Mondays in schools. However, college-aged men were less supportive of meat-free school lunches than some other groups. For example, 45% of young men said they would support this policy compared to 58% of all 18-24-year olds, 51% of all men, and 61% of the U.S. as a whole. Young men were also less likely to center a meal around a plant-based protein (41%) compared to their age group as a whole (47%), all men (45%), and the whole country (49%).
- Women ages 18-24 years old are probably one of the groups most likely to take action for animals
- More than 80% of young women said they would sign a petition to help farmed animals,
- One key exception worth noting here: Republican women said they were particularly likely to buy only ‘cruelty free’ products.
- We found that suburban residents didn’t necessarily respond more like urban residents or more like rural residents.
- With most pro-animal asks, advocates working with low-income Hispanic or Latino/a/x communities may have a lot of success in their outreach.
