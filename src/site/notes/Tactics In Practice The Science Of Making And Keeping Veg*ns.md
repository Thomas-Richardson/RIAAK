In this deep dive, we use research and visual guides to walk you through the process of encouraging new people to go veg, and strategies for helping them stay veg.

Welcome to the sixth edition of Faunalytics’ [Tactics In Practice](https://faunalytics.org/tactics-in-practice/), a series of resources where we explore the science behind different animal advocacy interventions and strategies and how you can make the most of them for animals. In this edition, we’re taking a close look at the process of making new veg\*ns (vegetarians and vegans), and how we can retain them.

### What’s Up With U.S. Veg\*nism?

*“We need to look at the data instead of assuming vegan and vegetarian numbers are growing.”* — karol orzechowski, Faunalytics

**The percentage of U.S. adults identifying as vegetarian or vegan (a group we call “veg\*n”) hasn’t significantly increased, despite the rise in vegan and vegetarian options in stores and restaurants.**

Faunalytics is driven by data, even when the data comes back to us with its tail between its legs. The growth of vegetarianism and veganism in the U.S. is one of those moments. Much as we’d like to say otherwise, the percent of adults who are veg\*n hasn’t significantly increased in decades.

True, there are plenty of optimistic reports on vegan food sales or occasional surveys about vegan numbers going up. But this doesn’t necessarily mean the number of veg\*ns is rising. For starters, several challenges make comparing surveys difficult:

- **Definitions:** Some surveys ask people to self-identify as vegetarian or vegan, while others inquire about specific food consumption. More people tend to claim they are vegetarian or vegan than prove to actually adhere to the diets when asked about specific food consumption. Also, there are far more ways to refer to one’s diet now than there used to be (e.g., flexitarian, reducetarian, plant-forward), which further complicates things.
- **Methodology:** Results can vary depending on whether the survey is conducted by phone or online. For example, people may be more inclined to answer in ways they think will please the interviewer or fail to disclose embarrassing information when responding by phone. Phone surveys also may reach a slightly older audience with online research engaging more younger respondents.
- **Margin of Error:** Surveys reach only a small portion of the population, making results approximate estimates rather than exact. Variations over time may reflect normal statistical fluctuations among respondents.

One of the most well-known U.S. research organizations, **Gallup**  has polled on vegetarian and vegan identity for over two decades. Their most recent data, from 2023, shows that **4% of U.S. adults identify as vegetarian and just 1% as vegan, a decline from 5% and 3% in 2018**. Earlier Gallup polls found similarly low rates of vegetarianism, with little change since 1999.

The **Vegetarian Resource Group (VRG)** has also conducted surveys since 1994. While methods differ, their findings align with Gallup’s: limited growth in plant-based eating.

This isn’t all bad news. The number of veg\*ns is far from the only societal metric that indicates benefits to animals, but it’s still worthy of consideration. In this resource, we set out to answer the age-old animal advocacy question: how can we make (and keep!) a veg\*n?

VRG also covers other measures such as people’s purchases of veg products, willingness to order veg entrees in restaurants, and preferences for labeling products from animal genes or DNA.

### We’re Adding New Veg\*ns, But Most Don’t Stick With It

*“I wish I had understood sooner just how hard it is to persuade people to change. The lapsed vegan and vegetarian numbers show we need data to guide us.”* — Che Green, [Cultivate Insights](https://cultivateinsights.com/)

**In 2014, Faunalytics conducted a pivotal study revealing that for every one person surveyed who was still veg\*n, five had tried the diet but reverted to their previous eating habits.**

10% of all respondents had attempted a veg\*n diet and given up, compared to 2% who were veg\*n at the time of the survey. If this ex-veg\*n rate held true using the most recent [census data for mid-2024](https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/popest/2020s-national-detail.html), it would equate to *over 26 million people*.

Many of these “ex-veg\*ns” weren’t motivated by animals, didn’t try it for very long, or may have been influenced by trends more than ethics. Still, this study should demonstrate to the movement that we need to take veg\*n retention seriously. If we work harder to make new veg\*ns more comfortable with their new eating habits, they will be more likely to maintain a cruelty-free diet. In a piece of good news, people who attempted a veg\*n diet [ate less meat after quitting the diet](https://faunalytics.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Faunalytics-Study-of-Current-and-Former-Vegetarians-and-Vegans-%E2%80%93-Secondary-Findings-.pdf) and 37% would consider trying again, meaning that these failed attempts still yield some benefits.

### People Prefer Small Actions To Major Change

*“Advocacy isn’t only about diet. Deep conversations and policy asks can move people who might resist vegan messaging.”* — Eva Hamer, [Pax Fauna](https://paxfauna.org/)

Many of us have been veg\*n for so long that we might have forgotten the difficulties of the initial stages: trying a plant-based cheese, scouring food labels in the grocery store, searching for yummy recipes, and, of course, dealing with uncomfortable questions from friends or family. Changing one’s diet is a huge transformation, especially a diet associated with identity.

Compare this to the effort required to vote for a ballot initiative, sign a petition, or support Meatless Mondays in schools. It’s no surprise that **far more people are willing to take these smaller actions than to adopt a veg\*n diet**. Ballot initiatives, petitions, and Meatless Mondays can also reduce suffering and death for a vast number of animals. This is why many advocacy groups and funders have shifted their focus to institutional change rather than dietary outreach. The good news is that starting with smaller asks, such as signing a petition, may make people more likely to agree to larger behavioral changes later on. Don’t be afraid to start small.

### The Bottom Line

Changing minds and dinner plates is hard. Even if you started scarfing down cashew cheese the first time you saw a dairy farm investigation video, most other people aren’t in the same boat. This means we as a movement need to be very mindful and purposeful when we pursue diet change, and consider all of the diverse barriers and motivations for reducing animal product consumption.

Don’t fear, we have some evidence-based ideas for you to try. Check out this infographic to give you a framework to make a new veg\*n, and read on below for more detail on each step in the process.

1\. Research

#### Learn What Works And What Doesn’t

*“Understanding behavior change through research is essential. People often move in steps rather than all at once.”* — Chris Bryant, [Bryant Research](https://bryantresearch.co.uk/)

**We must use research to understand our audiences.** A common mistake animal advocates make is assuming that what worked for them will work with others. Not all of the people you are trying to reach think the same way you do, however. If they did, they’d already be vegan! Developing plans based on what you assume works can often lead to less effective decisions. Research reveals what actually is most likely to succeed.

Research also helps you identify what’s working and what’s not for existing campaigns and programs. Evaluating your efforts with research is one of the smartest ways to ensure your resources make the greatest impact for animals. For example, Animal Equality partnered with Faunalytics to measure how its [360-degree virtual reality video affected pork consumption](https://faunalytics.org/video-outreach-impact-pork-consumption/) by college students. Interestingly, the study found that traditional, more affordable 2D videos were as effective as the 360-degree technology in influencing change.

Research tells the truth about where we are. A lot of people are surprised that the number of vegetarians and vegans hasn’t increased much and that the number of lapsed veg\*ns is so high. Learning these facts has motivated many organizations to shift focus from individual to institutional change through corporations and government to create even more impact for farmed animals.

**Advocates need to stay up-to-date on the latest research**, including tactics on how to apply it to their work or how to conduct it themselves. Faunalytics makes research understandable and actionable even if you’re not a research expert.

2\. Rank

#### Prioritize Smaller Animals

**Because fishes and chickens are so much smaller than cows, pigs, and most other farmed mammals, many [more individuals are killed to provide a similar amount of food](https://faunalytics.org/animal-product-impact-scales/).** In fact, it takes more than 200 chickens to provide as much meat as one cow. The number for sea animals is even higher. More than 750 fishes and 31 *thousand* shrimps are equivalent to one cow! As a result, [in the U.S., more than 9.5 *billion* chickens were slaughtered in 2022 compared to nearly 35 million cows](https://faunalytics.org/global-animal-slaughter-statistics-and-charts/). Fishes aren’t even measured as individuals, meaning we only know how many tons of fish were killed: more than 4.2 million. But according to [some estimates](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/animal-welfare/article/estimating-global-numbers-of-farmed-fishes-killed-for-food-annually-from-1990-to-2019/765A7CCA23ADA0249EF37CFC5014D351), it easily exceeds even the astonishing number of chickens killed.

Some have hypothesized that health and environmental arguments can unintentionally push people away from beef and pork toward chickens and fishes, thereby increasing the number of animals killed. A [meta-analysis of outreach interventions](https://faunalytics.org/quantifying-the-small-body-problem/), however, found no consistent evidence that advocacy campaigns are causing this substitution effect. Some studies did show increases in small-bodied animal consumption while others showed decreases, producing an overall null result.

This variation matters for strategy. Advocates should recognize the broader risk while also noting that current outreach does not appear to have systematically worsened the problem. The findings of the meta-analysis highlight that one promising way forward is the use of choice architecture. This involves structuring environments so that plant-based foods are easier to choose, without limiting consumer freedom. For example, dining halls and restaurants might offer a plant-based “dish of the day,” or retailers might display plant-based meats directly next to animal-based options. Evidence suggests that such nudges reduce consumption of small-bodied animals, and they are very unlikely to increase it. For this reason, choice architecture appears to be a safe bet for advocates seeking to address the small body problem while still moving people toward more plant-based diets.

#### Next Steps:

- Explore trends for [animal slaughter in the U.S. and other countries](https://faunalytics.org/global-animal-slaughter-statistics-and-charts/). (Use table *Global Animal Slaughter By Country*.)
- Examine data on [animals’ lives per pound of food](https://faunalytics.org/animal-product-impact-scales/). (Relative number of animals per one cow calculated by taking ratio of number of lives per pound of product in the charts.)
- Read about some [solutions to the small body problem from Bryant Research](https://bryantresearch.co.uk/insight-items/solutions-small-body-problem/).
- Learn more about [findings on substitution and how to use choice architecture](https://faunalytics.org/quantifying-the-small-body-problem/) to minimize potential problems.
- When convincing people to eat fewer chickens and fishes, consider the top messages that appeal to them. [Our research](https://faunalytics.org/chicken-and-fish-1/) has shown that these messages include demonstrating these animals’ emotions, personality, intelligence, and socialness.

3\. Refine

#### Target And Tailor Outreach

*“The biggest wins come when we create an open, welcoming space that brings everyone along, no matter their reasons for eating plant-based.”* — Jill Eckart, [Physicians Committee For Responsible Medicine](https://www.pcrm.org/)

**There is no magic message or “one size fits all” approach to effectively inspire people to become veg\*n.** You can get better results by focusing on specific subgroups of the population and tailoring your outreach to their needs. We [tested this ourselves at Faunalytics](https://faunalytics.org/different-strokes-for-different-folks/) by analyzing U.S. demographic groups and their openness to diet change (among other pro-animal actions).

The results speak for themselves: students are the most open to becoming vegetarian and are the second most receptive group to veganism. Black Americans are the most willing to go vegan. [Apex Advocacy](https://www.apexadvocacy.org/), [Black Veg Society](https://blackvegsociety.org/), [Afro-Vegan Society](https://www.afrovegansociety.org/), and others along with long-term advocates such as [Tracye McQuirter](https://byanygreensnecessary.com/) are advancing authentic, culturally appropriate outreach in communities of color.

Psychographic factors such as attitudes, beliefs, and lifestyles can be even more influential. For example, people concerned about climate change are more than twice as likely to consider animal-friendly actions. It’s easier to inspire those already inclined toward plant-based diets than to persuade resistant individuals. A potentially promising opportunity lies in re-engaging former vegetarians and vegans, more than a third of whom would be likely to try again.

Once you’ve identified your target audience, choose asks, messages, and outreach methods that resonate with them. Consider partnerships that could strengthen your efforts. Different groups, such as college students interested in the environment or middle-aged men with high cholesterol, have different motivations. Help them see the relevant benefits of veg eating without overwhelming them with every possible reason. If they try veg, you can provide additional messages over time to reinforce their commitment.

Organizations can use research to craft effective campaigns and programs. Individual advocates can not only review research, but also listen when engaging people directly to learn what matters most to them.

#### Next Steps:

- Learn about creating subgroups of your target audience [here](https://faunalytics.org/understanding-segmentation-how-to-more-effectively-target-your-message/).
- Find out [which groups were mostly likely to take pro-animal actions](https://faunalytics.org/different-strokes-for-different-folks/), including dietary change. Check out the full report and the [interactive graphing tool](https://faunalytics.shinyapps.io/comparing-pro-animal-openness/) for detailed findings.
- Use the Faunalytics [Animal Tracker graphing tool](https://faunalytics.org/advocates-allies-adversaries-12-years-of-faunalytics-animal-tracker/) to learn more about how different people think about animal issues.
- Find out what research says about [reactivating former veg\*ns](https://faunalytics.org/veg-obstacle-analysis/).
- Determine how you could achieve better results by prioritizing fewer audiences and attracting them more effectively.

4\. Relate

#### Meet People Where They Are

**Advocating for reducing animal product consumption, not eliminating it, can be a win for farmed animals.** As early as 2007, [Faunalytics research](https://faunalytics.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/HRC_Veg_Study_2007.pdf) showed that nearly one-fourth of the adult population said they were likely to reduce their meat consumption by half, while only 7% were likely to eliminate meat entirely. Our [2020 study](https://faunalytics.org/reduce-or-go-veg/) also showed an advantage in promoting meat reduction. It found that 26% of people who watched a reduction messaging video ordered a veg entree after, as compared to 19% who watched an elimination messaging video. Four times as many people were interested in taking a reduction pledge as opposed to a vegetarian pledge.

Since then, additional research has confirmed the potential of advocating for meat reduction.

- [A U.K. study](https://meatfreemondays.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/deVisser_etal_inPress_MFM.pdf) summarized [here](https://www.brighton.ac.uk/news/2021/brighton-medical-school-study-reveals-effectiveness-of-meat-free-monday) reported that one-third of people who participated in Meat Free Monday became vegetarian or vegan after five years, and one in five turned vegetarian or vegan in three to five years. Faunalytics found that [61% of U.S. adults](https://faunalytics.org/different-strokes-for-different-folks/) were likely to support a Meatless Monday policy in schools.
- [Another study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272494421000451) showed more people ate less meat after reading a reduction-focused op-ed compared to those who read one advocating elimination.
- [Research](https://faunalytics.org/how-many-former-vegetarians-and-vegans-are-there/) also revealed that 43% of lapsed veg\*ns thought it was too difficult to maintain a “pure” diet.
- Studies by [Faunalytics](https://faunalytics.org/different-strokes-for-different-folks/#), [Vegetarian Resource Group](https://www.vrg.org/journal/vj2020issue4/2020_issue4_poll_results.php), and others have found that large numbers of people are likely to order a veg entree when dining out or buy a meat substitute. The growth in plant-based food products is largely driven by non-veg\*ns.
- Even those interested in becoming entirely plant-based are unlikely to do so overnight. Just 21% claimed an instant transition in a [Faunalytics study](https://faunalytics.org/going-veg-many-paths/). Most new-to-veg individuals take at least a few days or weeks (38%), many weeks or a few months (34%), or even many months (7%).

Taken together, the research shows that an overnight switch to veganism based on a “go vegan” message is pretty rare, when compared to gradual, semi-perfect diets. Whether you are advocating for veganism or reduction, think about how to help people evolve over time if they’re not ready for an immediate change.

#### Next Steps:

- Read more about how people’s [imperfect and varied paths](https://faunalytics.org/going-veg-many-paths/) to plant-based eating can help animals.
- Take [*The Science of Effective Vegan Advocacy* course](https://veganadvocacy.org/science/) from Center for Effective Vegan Advocacy. You’ll learn ways to make your outreach as impactful as possible, including why to avoid confrontational and shaming approaches.
- Consider that while promoting reduction instead of elimination may be challenging for veg\*ns, it may be more effective in saving animals. Getting someone to take the first step can lead to greater success in the future.

5\. Reach

#### Use Effective Outreach Methods

**We want to invest our limited money, time, and energy in what works best to create change for animals.** In a landmark [2022 study](https://faunalytics.org/relative-effectiveness/), Faunalytics tested 16 types of advocacy to determine which had the most impact on changing behaviors and attitudes toward farmed animals. This two-part study explored influences on dietary change and willingness to sign petitions for better welfare. News articles, social media posts, classroom education, and meat-free challenges showed the most influence. Protests, whether disruptive or non-disruptive, were least effective in promoting diet change. (However, they may be helpful for other goals, such as pressuring corporations or bringing new advocates into the movement.)

Results varied for meat-reducers (reducetarians, pescatarians, and vegetarians) compared to full meat-eaters (omnivores). For example, news articles and social media posts reduced self-reported animal product consumption for people who identify as part of a meat-avoiding group, but not for full meat-eaters.

#### Next Steps:

- See the findings on effective outreach methods with this [infographic](https://faunalytics.org/relative-effectiveness-infographic/).
- Read the [full report](https://faunalytics.org/relative-effectiveness/), which also includes the impact of welfare labels, findings related to different species, demographic breakouts, and much more.
- Consider which methods would be most effective to engage your target audience.

6\. Reinforce

#### Encourage A Commitment

*“People are far more likely to stick with change when they make a clear pledge or commitment.”* — Allison Troy, Faunalytics

**Extensive research across various behavior change efforts shows that people are more likely to take action when they make a pledge or commitment.** Individuals who commit to a small action are more likely to agree to a bigger action later than those who did not make a pledge.

Faunalytics tracked more than 200 new veg\*ns over six months to identify what made them more likely to stick with their new diet. The level of commitment at the beginning of the study (how sure participants were that they would continue the diet) was a significant predictor of whether they maintained the diet or abandoned it. Pledges can help create accountability and follow-through.

#### Next Steps:

- Understand more about the [value of commitments](https://medium.com/@NickCooney/the-power-of-commitment-nick-cooney-d5653cc7dec8).
- See [the impact of pledges](https://faunalytics.org/going-veg-many-paths/) on people new to veg eating, then access tips to make yours effective.
- Do you have an online list of people who’ve taken a small action, such as signing a petition, that you could contact to take a next step?

7\. Retain

#### Support New-To-Veg Eaters From The Start

*“Make plant-based eating easy and tasty. The simpler it is, the more people will stick with it.”* — Brian Kateman, [Reducetarian Foundation](https://www.reducetarian.org/)

**With potentially five times as many former veg\*ns as current ones, it’s crucial to develop strategies to help people stay on track.** The best time to do this is during the planning phase of a new campaign or program. However, you can also incorporate retention efforts into existing initiatives.

While people may be motivated to eat plant-based for health, environmental, or animal welfare reasons, [research](https://faunalytics.org/a-summary-of-faunalytics-study-of-current-and-former-vegetarians-and-vegans/) found that people lapsed due to dissatisfaction with food (32%), health concerns (26%), discomfort in social situations (13%), and perceived inconvenience (13%). About a third of lapsed veg\*ns maintained the diet for three months or less, and slightly more than half stuck with it for less than one year.

Let’s take a page from the business world: it’s far easier (and cheaper!) to *retain* a client than to gain a new one. We need to invest time and energy into ensuring new veg\*ns are as satisfied as possible, especially around their relationship with veg\*n food. Tasty products, exciting recipes, how-to guides, and more nutritional information can help new-to-veg people keep going.

#### Next Steps:

- Read more about [why people lapse](https://faunalytics.org/a-summary-of-faunalytics-study-of-current-and-former-vegetarians-and-vegans/), [the barriers they face](https://faunalytics.org/going-veg-barriers-and-strategies/), and what it would take to [bring former veg\*ns back](https://faunalytics.org/veg-obstacle-analysis/).
- Estimate or measure what percentage of the people you engage in veg eating stick with it. Set up ongoing evaluations to see whether your efforts are creating long-term veg\*ns.

	- Faunalytics has sample survey questions you can use [here](https://faunalytics.org/survey-questions/).
- Assess your current programs, campaigns, and other initiatives to determine how well they support people through their initial challenges. Consider adding information, resources, or other outreach to improve your results.

Need help on how to measure your results? Read our tips on [how to design a study](https://faunalytics.org/designing-a-study/). Come to virtual [office hours](https://faunalytics.org/ask-us/) if you have questions.

8\. Re-Engage

#### Invite And Assist Lapsed Veg\*ns To Try Again

**Former veg\*ns could be a fruitful target for your outreach efforts.** In 2014, Faunalytics found [10% of U.S. adults](https://faunalytics.org/a-summary-of-faunalytics-study-of-current-and-former-vegetarians-and-vegans/) were former veg\*ns and many were inclined to try again. More than a third of former veg\*ns were interested in re-adopting the diet, which is more than 9 million people. A majority of them said they were likely or very likely to do so, with health being the primary motivator.

People who are already positively disposed toward veg eating and already have experience with diet change should be easier to re-engage than those with less interest. This may be an under-tapped opportunity for our movement.

#### Next Steps:

- Find out what research says it would take to [reactivate past veg\*ns](https://faunalytics.org/veg-obstacle-analysis/).
- Investigate if there are ways you could reach past veg\*ns to help them resume their plant-based path.
- Plan your programs, campaigns, and other efforts to help new-to-veg people succeed in their first attempt.

9\. Rejuvenate

#### Care For Yourself And Others

*“Don’t get stuck in anger or perfectionism. Sustainable advocacy means caring for yourself as much as you care for the animals.”* — Melanie Joy, [Center for Effective Vegan Advocacy](https://veganadvocacy.org/)

**The challenges of becoming vegan, staying vegan, and advocating for veganism are significant.** Psychological stress can be a major factor for animal advocates. Advocates may struggle with feeling overwhelmed or hopeless, or worry that their individual efforts aren’t enough. It’s crucial to monitor and prioritize your physical and mental health. Connecting with like-minded individuals can reduce feelings of isolation and provide practical and emotional support.

Not only is burnout a topic [Faunalytics has dealt with and highlighted](https://faunalytics.org/announcing-new-beginnings-for-faunalytics-research-department/) but it affects the entire movement. [Our research](https://faunalytics.org/advocate-retention/) has shown that 21% of former advocates left organizations because of burnout. We can do better.

Organizations that foster a “martyrdom culture,” where working long hours is seen as a source of pride, should reevaluate their policies and practices. Additionally, we need to prevent the discrimination and harassment that disproportionately harm women, BIPOC, and others in the animal protection movement. It’s essential to support our colleagues if we are to change the world for farmed animals.

#### Next Steps:

- Understand the [different types of stress you and other advocates experience](https://faunalytics.org/no-ones-paying-me-to-cry-burnout-and-animal-advocacy/) and what [causes turnover at animal protection organizations](https://faunalytics.org/advocate-retention/).
- Check out the Center for Effective Vegan Advocacy’s [*Sustainable Vegan Advocacy* course](https://veganadvocacy.org/sva/) to learn ways to avoid burnout.
- Prioritize your self-care and encourage others to do so. The Humane League has links to a [variety of resources](https://animalpolicyalliance.org/self-care).
- Learn more about [making our movement more positive and effective for people of color](https://sentientmedia.org/research-data-inclusive-animal-rights-movement/).
- Support colleagues individually and help foster positive group cultures. Organizations can learn more about helping organizers and volunteers with [resources from Pax Fauna](https://organizer.paxfauna.org/).

10\. Redirect

#### Consider Systemic Alternatives To Individual Diet Advocacy

*“If you can move institutions, they’ll move many other people for you.”* — Tobias Leenaert, [ProVeg International](https://proveg.org/), [The Vegan Strategist](http://tobiasleenaert.substack.com/)

**Of the [14 barriers to veg\*nism we tested in 2022](https://faunalytics.org/going-veg-barriers-and-strategies/), at least eight of them are systemic in some way, such as cultural influence, stigma, cost of veg products, not a strong enough veg\*n network, and more.** Because of data like this, many organizations are shifting from individual outreach to systemic work: changing menus, lowering the prices of veg options, changing legal standards, and more. These efforts can create changes in systems, norms, and culture that lead to more veg eating in the future. The idea is that by shifting cultural norms and food systems, we can lower the barriers for veg\*nism for everyone.

Other advocates have become less interested in changing consumers’ minds and have shifted their efforts to producers by campaigning for higher-welfare farming practices, ballot measures, legal restrictions on farms, and more. These institutional approaches work by both helping animals in the short term while also checking the power of Big Meat.

We believe that all forms of advocacy are necessary. We need a movement addressing systemic issues while also talking to individuals about their decisions and behavior. Long-term change needs to be fought on multiple fronts.

	- Sentience Institute reviews the pros and cons of different types of campaigns as well as for a variety of strategies and tactics on its *[Summary of Evidence for Foundational Questions in Effective Animal Advocacy](https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/foundational-questions-summaries#individual-vs.-institutional-interventions-and-messaging)* page.
- Review research and recommendations from Pax Fauna on [engaging people as citizens rather than consumers](https://narrative.paxfauna.org/#video_section).
- Review the [data on plant-based nudges and defaults](https://faunalytics.org/tactics-in-practice-the-science-of-plant-based-defaults-and-nudges/), which are becoming a popular and effective intervention.
- Review government and corporate initiatives to promote plant-based foods to help with sustainability: [Lidl UK](https://www.veganfoodandliving.com/news/lidl-uk-triples-its-plant-based-range-and-sets-ambitious-goal-for-plant-based-protein-sales/), [the Danish government](https://www.forbes.com/sites/danieladelorenzo/2023/11/23/how-denmark-made-the-plant-based-action-plan-possible/), and various U.S. cities via the [Planted Society](https://plantedsociety.org/). Think about how this could apply to your work.
- Reflect with your team and/or individually on your advocacy efforts. Are you using your resources in the most effective way? Are there new initiatives you should pursue, either instead of or in addition to your current activities? Which types of efforts will allow you to do the most good for farmed animals?

Creating lasting change for farmed animals requires a thoughtful, research-driven approach. **While the number of veg\*ns in the U.S. hasn’t significantly increased, that doesn’t mean progress isn’t happening. By understanding why people lapse, tailoring outreach to specific audiences, and supporting new veg\*ns** with practical tools and resources, advocates can help more people make and maintain compassionate dietary choices.
