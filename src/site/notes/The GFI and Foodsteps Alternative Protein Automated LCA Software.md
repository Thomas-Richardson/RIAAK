[The GFI and Foodsteps Alternative Protein Automated LCA Software](https://www.foodsteps.earth/alternative-proteins)

Foodsteps, a specialized sustainability platform, designed and launched a new LCA modeling software in May of 2024. GFI supported the development of the free version, which allows for the assessment of up to five products across three key impact categories—carbon emissions, water use, and land use—measuring products’ ecological footprint from cradle (agricultural stage) to factory gate (end of manufacturing, but pre-packaging).

Currently, the software can best serve plant-based and biomass fermentation products. It guides effective, sustainable decision-making in product design, production scale, and location while providing internal sustainability reporting. Foodsteps’ premium version includes impact certification, ensuring a third party verifies your data to facilitate external claims.
