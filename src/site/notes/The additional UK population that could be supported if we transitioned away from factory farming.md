For a 10% meat reduction, we need the amount of meat Brits currently eat.

Then we assume half of that comes from less pork and half from chicken, meaning a reduction of pork of Xg and chicken of Yg. This translates into a X2% decrease in pork and Y2% decrease in chicken. 

This means that X2% and Y2% of land used to grow chicken and pig feed is freed up, and considering that they take up X3% and Y3% of crop land, which is 40%? of total cropland, we'd free up X4% and Y4% of cropland.

If alt proteins take Z% of the land of chicken and pork, that means we can produce
