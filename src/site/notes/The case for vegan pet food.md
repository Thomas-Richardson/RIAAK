- Pet ownership is skyrocketing, particularly in China. Pets now account for nearly 30% of the GHG footprint of a Chinese citizen. There is serious concern of a protein shortage with current rates of pet ownership increase.  
- Allergies to meat, including chicken protein, are actually very common. The allergen dog food category is growing substantially, especially with designer breed dogs and their myriad health issues. Many of those dogs end up eating plant-based foods or novel proteins (like crocodiles, wtf) currently.  
- Current pet food is made with rendered meat, which is extremely dangerous to consume without extensive treatment. Thus, there are a variety of added costs when the food is processed, due to needing synthetic nutrition to be added back in. If the cultivated cells can include taurine and other synthetic nutrition currently added back in, it could reduce that cost, as well.
