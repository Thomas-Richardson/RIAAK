## The spread of US CAFOs
In 1990, small and medium-sized farms accounted for nearly half of all agricultural production in the US. Now it is less than a quarter. Missouri, to the south, had 23,000 independent pig farmers in 1985. Today it has just over 2,000. The number of independent cattle farms has fallen by 40% over the same period. [^1]
Between 1987 and 2007 the median hog farm size increased by 2,000 percent, while the number of farmers raising hogs fell by 69 percent[^1]. Dairy herd size and egg production saw similar shifts to much larger operations from 2007 to 2017[^2]

Iowa lost nearly 90 percent of its hog farms from 1982 to 2017, as rapid factory hog expansion drove out smaller, family-scale farms. [[Citations/Food and Water Watch, 2022\|Food and Water Watch, 2022]]

just three cooperatives market more than 80 percent of all fluid milk in the country[^3] 

## Europe

## [[Farming Evidence Pack (DEFRA)\|UK]]
See [[Citations/World animal protection, 2024\|World animal protection, 2024]] 
A mega-farm in the UK is roughly equivalent to a [Concentrated Animal Feeding Operation (CAFO)](https://plantbasednews.org/culture/film/film-north-carolina-pig-farming/) in the US:
- 2,500 or more pigs
- For dairy cows, the number is 700
- beef cows it’s 1,000
- At least 125,000 chickens raised for meat
- 82,000 “egg-laying” hens.
The UK had 1176 such farms in 2024
- Also in WAP report, between 2016 and 2021 the number of pig farms fell by 620 units but the pig population rose by 460,000 animals.
- According to CIWF, the UK saw a 20% rise in mega farms between 2016 and 2024

[[Citations/World animal protection, 2024\|World animal protection, 2024]] calculate that the largest poultry unit in England in Shropshire has 1.48M birds

For cows it's growing: https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cy4ldkpz1klo 
### Other definitions
- We might define a UK factory farm as one requiring a permit under the [[Farming Evidence Pack (DEFRA)#ELMS\|EPR]]:
	- 40k poultry
	- 2k pigs for meat
	- 750 sows
- Problem is this defines it based on size but there are smaller ones that are worse for welfare
- Also has no definition for cows

This article discusses some of the [big agri](https://www.sustainweb.org/news/may23-intensive-livestock-directors-pay/) involved in the UK
