[[Citations/Allan et al., 2019\|Allan et al., 2019]]: A macro-economic analysis of meat reduction in Scotland. Consumers save money from reducing their meat purchases, and if they spend this money in the wider economy, they found that the overall Scottish economy was better off. As a result, reducing meat consumption produced a 'triple dividend' of better health, better environment and better economy.
 
[[Citations/Pais et al., 2020\|Pais et al., 2020]] finds that while meat contributed positives to the GDP of high income countries, so do plant foods so replacing meat with plants would offeset most GDP damage.

[[Citations/Marques et al., 2018\|Marques et al., 2018]] argues that developed countries have historically seen slower GDP growth due to high meat diets. This is because while home meat industries may boost economic activity, a large amount of meat eaten is imported and this causes trade imbalances.

[[Citations/Duluins et al., 2022\|Duluins et al., 2022]] highlight a case study of Wallonia, Belgium, a key beef producing region. Here, they estimate that even in the face of declining beef consumption, farmers can change strategies to maintain profits by increasing their margins.

[[Citations/Greig and Wu, 2021\|Greig and Wu, 2021]] suggests that even the cow dependent Northern Irish economy could adapt.

[[Citations/Mason-D'Croz et al., 2022\|Mason-D'Croz et al., 2022]]  60% replacement of beef with beef alts results in 2% GDP increase
