#movement_building 

- When Social Change Lab did a [survey of 100+ political scientists and sociologists](https://www.apollosurveys.org/social-change-and-protests/), something that cropped up was the importance of having achievable demands.
- A lack of wins means you lose activists lose motivation and leave
- People like joining winning campaigns
- Defined campaigns build in natural cycles of intensity and rest
- In addition to the mobilisation benefits mentioned above, I believe campaigns that are either clearly time-bound (e.g. due to elections, votes or ballot initiatives) or provide clear feedback by other means (e.g. a company policy, change in institutional behaviour, etc.) are important for reasons for seasonality.
- I’ve come around to thinking that if campaigns don’t build in some cycles of intensity, followed by rest, then it’s a fast track to burnout for activists.
- Now, you might be thinking: "But what about movements like Extinction Rebellion or Occupy Wall Street? They achieved significant impact without highly specific or achievable demands." This is a fair point which I think is worth covering.
- There's a crucial drawback of these more symbolic goals: these groups often struggle with longevity. In my experience, without concrete wins to sustain motivation, these movements tend to experience a high turnover of volunteers and soon enough, declining participation.
- Once groups like Extinction Rebellion have done the groundwork of establishing climate change as a key issue in the UK and shifting discourse, Just Stop Oil can step in to achieve some tangible legislative victories.
