- 36% of our calories from crops go to animals and 88% of them are wasted in growing the animal, with only 12% being turned into food. ([[Citations/Cassidy et al., 2013\|Cassidy et al., 2013]]) 
- Globally monogastric animals (e.g., pigs and poultry) consume on average about 2 kg of human-edible feed protein to produce one kg of edible protein [[Citations/Mottet et al., 2017\|Mottet et al., 2017]] 
- 45% of a chicken or pig\'s body is inedible, 60% for cows
- As researchers we need to emphasise the food in vs edible mass of meat out.
- In particular, animals return 21% of the zinc they eat in human-edible crops
