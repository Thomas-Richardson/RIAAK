Interestingly, there is a paradox here. Veganism is about supply and demand. Supply of excellent plant-based food and demand for plant-based food. Similarly, supply of higher welfare animal products and demand for higher animal welfare products. We have to balance them.

Paradoxically, if investing in the supply side, for example with cage-free campaigns, is found to be very efficient, then if we assume that supply and demand are balanced, we should invest more resources in the less efficient one. That is because it will become the bottleneck. Any time there is an imbalance in supply and demand, the side we do not have enough of becomes the bottleneck, so we have to balance them.
