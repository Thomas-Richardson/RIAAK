#pkm #research 

- A core problem of researchers these days is managing knowledge: you read so many papers that remembering everything is impossible.
- At its core, we all need a place to store our notes. But a modern note taking system is far more than that:
	- It makes finding resurfacing and retrieving things you've learned effortless
	- It actively helps you process and understand the things you've read.
	- It is structured in a way that makes creation of new content fast and easy
	- It allows you to figure out where gaps in your knowledge are.
### Organising by tags and links
- By using tags, I can group notes by topic in a quick but powerful way. Rather than spending ages thinking how I will categorise my knowledge into non-overlapping folders, I can have tags that overlap as much or as little as I like.
	- Searching by tags allows for quickly identifying all articles on a topic or combination of topics: "What notes do I have on the #economics #factory_farming in #lower_middle_income_countries ?"
	- I imagine that eventually AI assistants will be good enough that this will not be necessary.
- By using links, I can build a web of how ideas and studies relate to each other. 
	- By clicking from link to link, you can surface along a trail of thought.
## Citations and micro-content as the backbone of your knowledge base
RIAAK broadly has 2 types on content in them: citations and micro-content.

Citations are notes on papers, reports and occasionally blogs I've read. Anything I might cite. Each piece gets its own note. I add citation notes when they become useful to me. The goal is not to add every animal advo study ever. As such citations will typically be:
- Influential papers and reports
- Reviews and meta analyses
- case studies
- Note all citations should have links to at least 1 piece of microcontent

Micro-content is basically piece of writing by me. They collect together 

- Using AI-embedding driven links
