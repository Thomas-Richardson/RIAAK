- The small animal replacement problem assumes that when people switch from eating larger animals to eating smaller animals, nothing else has changed in their beliefs or attitudes towards animals.
- However, under the situation of moral circle expansion, this switch might be exactly what we would expect to see—the elimination of eating mammals first, followed by birds, followed by fish and other animals, roughly in the order of evolutionary similarity to humans and proximity to humans—and thus this progressive elimination (and replacement) might indicate psychological ethical progress.
- In the long-term this is the trajectory we might expect to see on the way towards the moral inclusion of animals in our societies.
- When an action with a replacement risk does not appear to coincide with moral circle expansion
