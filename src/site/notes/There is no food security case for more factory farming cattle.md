#food_security #cawf_food_sec #uk 

Currently, most cattle in the UK are not factory farmed, and graze on pasture for most of their lives.*However, [there is a rising trend](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cy4ldkpz1klo) of "zero-grazing" cattle farms or cattle who are confined inside factory farms for their entire lives. Proponents argue that this trend is positive for UK food security, but there are several reasons why this is not the case:

1. The UK produces enough meat and dairy to entirely meet domestic demand and has for the last 2 decades. [We are self-sufficient in beef and dairy](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/6756e355d89258d2868dae76/United_Kingdom_Food_Security_Report_2024_11dec2024_web_accessible.pdf), so do not need to produce more. And crucially, [UK consumers are moving away from beef](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/per-capita-meat-consumption-by-type-kilograms-per-year?facet=metric&country=~GBR) and demand for dairy [may have stalled](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/milk-production-tonnes?tab=chart&stackMode=relative&country=~GBR). A key selling point of factory farming is that it can increase production, but producing more of what we do not want does nothing for food security. 
2. Beef and dairy are the [leading contributors](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aaq0216) in the food system towards climate change, and climate change is [one of the biggest](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/6756e355d89258d2868dae76/United_Kingdom_Food_Security_Report_2024_11dec2024_web_accessible.pdf) medium to long-term risks to UK food security. 
3. A key pillar of UK security is the affordability of a nutritious diet for all. Whilst beef and dairy are sources of important nutrients, these nutrients can easily be gotten from other sources, typically much cheaper than beef. Furthermore, many food security [experts argue](https://www.nationalfoodstrategy.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/4_NFS_Report_spv_Ch3_Health.pdf) that a food system that promotes obesity lowers food security. All reputable medical bodies ([including the NHS](https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/eat-well/food-types/meat-nutrition/)) agree that [the UK public consumes more red meat than is healthy](https://eatforum.org/eat-lancet-commission/), and red meat contributes towards many health problems, [costing the NHS millions](https://www.conservativeanimalwelfarefoundation.org/resources/the-2-billion-nhs-windfall-why-meat-reduction-matters/).
	- It may even undermine this pillar of food security because factory farming is associated with [numerous costs to the taxpayers](https://www.conservativeanimalwelfarefoundation.org/factory-farming/the-conservative-animal-welfare-foundation-cawf-has-published-a-landmark-new-report-revealing-the-hidden-costs-of-factory-farms-to-the-uk-taxpayer-using-publicly-available-uk-governme/). If these costs reduce the money in consumers' pockets, then they have less money to afford food. 
4. Factory-farmed cattle are typically fed far more grains than grazed animals. Where will we get these grains? Will we put further pressure on our [limited cropland](https://www.wwf.org.uk/sites/default/files/2022-06/future_of_feed_summary.pdf)? Or will we [import more soy from Brazil](https://landworkersalliance.org.uk/soy-no-more/), fuelling the destruction of the rainforest and increasing our dependence on other countries for our food supply? 

## The real reason cattle farmers are considering intensification
The key driver of more factory-farmed cattle is that cattle farmers struggle to earn a stable profit from their work. On lowland grazing farms many cattle farmers [struggle to even turn a profit](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/farm-business-income/farm-business-income-by-type-of-farm-in-england-202324). This is because [big meat corporations/processors and supermarkets squeeze farmers](https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/stories/2018-05-29/inside-britains-new-intensive-agriculture-sector-beef-lots/) tighter and tighter in order to minimise costs to consumers. Many are also intensifying because they are increasingly having to compete with [low-welfare, cheaper imports](https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/stories/2018-05-29/inside-britains-new-intensive-agriculture-sector-beef-lots/) from other countries. 

Many UK cattle farmers truly are in crisis, but factory farming cattle is not the answer. If we look at poultry and pig farming, where factory farming is far more established, we can see that factory farming does not bring more security for farmers. Poultry and pig farmers are struggling as much as dairy and beef farmers are. The issue is that any increases in farmer profits that come from being able to produce meat more cheaply are immediately eroded by the processes and supermarkets. 

What's worse, it could leave some farmers worse off. If consumer demand stays constant or continues to decline, any increased sales from one cattle farmer will come at the cost of sales to another cattle farmer. Some will benefit, but only because others go bust. Overall British farming would be in no better health. This situation might be avoided if farmers export excess beef, but is it really a solution to UK food security for some farmers to stop producing food for the British public? Competing with other beef exporting countries on international markets has no guarantee of being profitable and brings its own risks and challenges. 

## Better solutions for UK cattle farmers
We believe there are 2 better solutions for struggling British cattle farmers: 
- Restructure agricultural subsidy schemes to pay these farmers to convert their grazing land into carbon storing forests. This will produce a double benefit: lowering our emissions as well as sucking carbon back out the atmosphere. it would also improve biodiversity. UK cattle farmers could therefore lead the charge in getting the UK to Net Zero.
- If their grazing land is unsuitable for crops, the government can provide initial grants/loans for cattle farmers to create solar farms on their land. Instead of providing energy to the UK through calories and protein, they can provide energy through clean electricity!

Both of these solutions are discuss in a paper by [The Green Alliance](https://green-alliance.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Shaping-UK-land-use.pdf), that also models land use change.

Some cattle farmers will balk at the idea of moving away from cattle; they may feel they are abandoning the calling of their fathers and grandfathers before them. However, will factory farming really be any better? Though a factory cattle farmer can still claim the job title of cattle farmer, their day to day will be unrecognisable. Instead of presiding over fields of green, their time will be spent among rows and rows of cattle who will never see daylight or get to express their natural behaviours. On the other hand, land conversion could allow cattle farmers to remain true to a key duty of every UK farmer: to be stewards of the Great British countryside. 

## Policy recommendations
- DEFRA should require factory cattle operations to [obtain environmental permits](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-if-you-need-an-environmental-permit) as it does for poultry and pigs, which will increase transparency about how many and where these farms are.
- The UK should require all beef and dairy imports to follow the same welfare and environmental standards as UK beef.
- The UK government should provide grants or loans to cattle farmers looking to convert some land to solar panels.
- The UK government should ensure a fair, reliable and easy to understand subsidy system for cattle farmers looking to convert grazing land to reforesting.
