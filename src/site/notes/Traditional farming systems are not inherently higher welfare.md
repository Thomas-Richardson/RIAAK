- Coignard et al. (2013) assess animal welfare according to the Welfare Quality protocol for cattle on 130 dairy farms in France, which have herd sizes ranging from 23 to 120 lactating cows. They find no significant impact of farm size on animal welfare.
- Knage-Rasmussen et al. (2013) conduct an on-farm welfare assessment according to the Welfare Quality protocol for 64 sow herds (herd size of 50–2,500) and 37 slaughter pig herds (herd size of 650–34,094 produced pigs per year). Their results show no significant associations between herd size and animal welfare level in either sow or slaughter pig herds. 
- Spiller et al. (2015, pp. 46–49) review the literature on the link between animal welfare and farm size and conclude that there is no systematic relationship.

## Bryant Africa report
Pastoral livestock in Africa are not necessarily high-welfare. Their access to food and water may be limited or uncertain, and they have virtually no access to veterinary care. Moreover, African livestock farmers self-report very low knowledge of animal welfare, and no particularly positive attitudes towards their animals overall. That said probably not worse than factory farmed
