#data
## What they say about their data

We only cover a subset of farms and it's based what data is available from the government. We build it from a few sources:

**FSA registered dairy establishments**
Covers all dairy farms in England and Wales. We don't have coverage for scotland and NI, although I'm sure the data will be available somewhere.  
See more at [https://data.food.gov.uk/catalog/datasets/4025207b-f03b-480b-869f-1186087dd42a](https://data.food.gov.uk/catalog/datasets/4025207b-f03b-480b-869f-1186087dd42a)


**DEFRA permitted installations** 
- Covers all Intensive ([Defra registered](https://environment.data.gov.uk/public-register/view/search-industrial-installations)) chicken and pig farms in England 

**Environmental Permits by Natural Resources Wales (Welsh Government Body)**  
- Covers all intensive chicken and pig farms in England
- This information isn't published anywhere and was obtained by a freedom of information request

**Environmental Permits by Department Of Agriculture, Environment And Rural Affairs**
- Covers all intensive chicken and pig farms in Northern Ireland
- Again this isn't published anywhere and was obtained by freedom of information request.
- The definition of intensive farms here is one used by the UK government for environmental regulation. Farms must apply for an environmental permit if they hold more than 40,000 poultry, 2,000 grower pigs or 750 breeding pigs.

There are gaps in our data, eg we don't have any intensive farms listed for Scotland. At the bottom of each farm page on our site we also have a "Attributions" section which shows which dataset we detected the farm in.
