[The Bureau of Investigative Journalism](https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/stories/2024-04-29/fields-of-filth-factory-farms-committing-thousands-of-environmental-breaches/) revealed that in England in the years up to 2024, intensive livestock units breached environmental regulations over 3000 times, including “routine” discharge of slurry and dirty water, maggot-infested carcass bins and the illegal incineration of pigs.

The Guardian found that [dairy farms](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/apr/19/most-uk-dairy-farms-ignoring-pollution-rules-as-manure-spews-into-rivers) in the UK broke environmental regulations more than a thousand times between 2020 and 2021, including by spilling waste into rivers.

## Regulations work
Since the introduction of environmental permit conditions for pig and poultry farms, emissions from these farms [have decreased by approximately 30%](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/64a6d9c1c531eb000c64fffa/environmental-improvement-plan-2023.pdf) (haven't checked this)
