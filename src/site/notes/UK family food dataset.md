- Data goes back to 1974 but mainly provide statistics from 2001 onwards.
- I think it comes from here: https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/family-food-fye-2022/family-food-fye-2022
- I think it surveys 5000 families
- Has 3 datasets: UK household purchases in g and ml
- UK eating out purchases
	- Includes spending on various takeout dishes and people buying lunches from supermarkets and such
- UK expenditure

There are many other datasets that break these 3 datasets down by income, region, age of household reference person, household composition, ethnic group, rural adn urban, economic status and occupation. Many of these datasets also include nutrient intake ( #health_nutrition).

## Useful to us?
- The household purchases have perhaps 2 veg categories: "Soya and novel protein foods" and non dairy milks
	- Can be used to track meat at a fine grained level
- Takeout data has a variety of veggie categories
- 

I made this graph (though due to data being in a weird format I copied and pasted the data directly into python, so hard to replicate):
