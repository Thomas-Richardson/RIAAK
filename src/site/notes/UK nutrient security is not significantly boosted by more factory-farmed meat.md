The [UK government's 2024 food security report](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/united-kingdom-food-security-report-2024/united-kingdom-food-security-report-2024-theme-4-food-security-at-household-level#sub-theme-3-diet-and-nutrition) notes that the UK population is not meeting the [Eatwell Guide (EWG)](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-eatwell-guide) recommendations for fruits vegetables and fibre more generally. In fact, just 7% of the population met fibre recommendations, and 74% were not eating enough fruits and vegetables.

**Calculate 10,20 and 50% alt protein swap in terms of increased fibre**

The UK is primarily deficient in:
- Iron
	- Meat is good for these
- Calcium
	- Meat is low in these
	- leafy greens and legumes are great
- Vitamin D
	- Chicken has no vit D
	- Pork and eggs are decent sources
	- Most vegetables contain no vitamin D but mushrooms are often better sources than meat.
- Magnesium
	- Meat is low in these
	- leafy greens and legumes are great
- Selenium
	- pork and eggs are good sources, chicken less so. Most veg contains little selenium.

## Increased fibre from alt proteins
- On average, alt proteins contain 3.1-6.0g of fibre per 100g ([[Citations/Espinosa et al., 2024\|Espinosa et al., 2024]])
- The average person eats 29.2g of pork and 37.4g of poultry [according to DEFRA](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9494176/) for a total 6.66g a day. If we assume they replace 6.66g of this with alt proteins, that means they're getting 
- [Average person eats 18g fibre but should be eating 30g](https://www.bda.uk.com/static/f602fc35-ff7f-4d2c-90c89b145c43396c/d1e5de73-14ad-4d53-a9a79d1f66f0e7f8/Fibre-food-fact-sheet.pdf)
