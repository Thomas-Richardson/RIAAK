# PU (Polyurethane) Vegan Leather
- Benefits: It's versatile, available in various textures and colors, and can closely mimic the appearance and feel of real leather.
- Bio-leather is made by using microbial processes to produce a leather-like material. Yeast, bacteria, and fungi are used to create a matrix that resembles collagen, which is the main component of animal leather.
# Cactus Leather (Desserto):
- Made from: Cactus leaves, which are cut, cleaned, mashed, and then turned into sheets
- Benefits: Durable, breathable, and has a similar feel to animal leather.
- Long-term durability is not fully known.
# Apple Leather
- Apple leather is created from the apple industry's waste like cores and peels. These are ground, mixed with polyurethane, and then applied to a fabric backing.
- It is durable, and its texture is close to real leather.
# Pineapple Leather (Piñatex)
- Made from the fibers of pineapple leaves
- Lightweight, strong, and has a unique texture. It provides additional income to pineapple farmers.
- The end product is not as supple as traditional leather
# Mushroom Leather (Mylo)
- Made from: Mycelium, the root structure of mushrooms. These are grown under controlled conditions, and then treated and tanned.
- It's soft, durable, and versatile.
- It's currently expensive to produce, and availability is limited.
# Cork
- Made from: Bark of cork oak trees. The bark is harvested without cutting down the tree
- Cork oak trees absorb more CO2 when the bark is regenerating.
- Lightweight, water-resistant, and durable.
# Mirum (Natural Fiber Welding)
- A combination of natural materials like hemp, cork, and coconut husks, bound together without using plastics or glue.
- Durable, versatile, and free from plastics or synthetic binders
- Limited availability and potentially higher costs due to the natural materials involved.
# Biophilica
- Bio-based polymers and natural fibers.
- It emulates the feel of traditional leather closely while being eco-friendly.
- As with other newer materials, large-scale production and long-term performance are still being studied.
