## Great advantages but energy demands are vast so cannot scale
https://www.sustainabilitybynumbers.com/p/vertical-farming

- Consistent yields
- Lower food miles
- Optimized water, sunlight spectrum, intensity, temperature, CO2, humidity
- Little to no pesticides
- Low water

### Green leafy Vegetables and lettuce is our best bet
Vegetables often grow in much shorter cycles, which, again, increases production and profitability. They’re relatively short in height compared to cereals, so they take up much less vertical space. Vegetables often require much more controlled conditions to grow well, making them better suited to perfectly controlled vertical farms.

## Yields from vertical wheat farming are insane but the energy costs are insaner

## There are fundamental physics reasons it can't work
There are, however, physical limits to the photosynthetic capacity of plants. Most crops convert just 1% to 6% of solar energy into biomass. The theoretical maximum is around 11%. That means the amount of kilograms of biomass you get per kWh of power has a floor. Even with highly skilled genetic engineering, the amount of lettuce, strawberries or wheat produced per kilowatt-hour is not going to increase by more than a factor of 10
