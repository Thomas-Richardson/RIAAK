Globally, compared to the amounts recommended in the EAT Lancet diet, we are over consuming #fish by 99%, poultry by 54%, and red meat by 398% (FAOSTAT, 2023; Willett et al., 2019).

We [already eat more](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/eat-lancet-diet-animal-products?country=EAT-Lancet~GBR) animal products than [[Citations/EAT Lancet\|EAT Lancet]] recommends. As of 2017 British consumption data we ate:
- 9.14 (128 vs 14g) times more #Meat/red_meat than recommended
- 1.92 (54g vs 28g) times more #fish than recommended
- 3.03 (88g vs 29g) times more #chickens than recommended
- 2.385 (31g vs 13g) times more #eggs than recommended
- 2.45 (613g vs 250g) times more #dairy than recommended
Since then red meat has decreased but white meat has increased: [[Citations/Stewart et al., 2021\|Stewart et al., 2021]]
