- During one hour of observation, [92.6%](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/21/21-468/233565/20220815174931670_Broom%20et%20al.%20amicus%20brief%20-%20Natl%20Pork%20v.%20Ross%20-%20No.%2021-468.pdf) of confined pigs exhibited stereotypies.
- Sham chewing is one stereotypic behavior that occupies [50-75%](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35565610/) of their waking hours.
- The lack of mobility causes them to suffer from constipation, [rectal prolapse](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/234538912_Rectal_Prolapse_in_Pregnant_Sows_due_to_Stall_Housing), [muscle wasting](https://www.efsa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2022-08/EFS2-7421.pdf), painful [pressure sores](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12322922/), and [urinary tract infections](https://www.dsm.com/anh/news/feed-talks/articles/urinary-tract-infections-a-silent-but-serious-problem-for-sows-and-their-progeny.html#).   
## Food safety concerns:
- Stress hormones, which are [elevated](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8300341/) in pigs confined to gestation crates, increase their susceptibility to infections and the [virulence](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-019-0293-3.pdf) of pathogens such as salmonella, campylobacter, and staphylococcus aureus.
- Piglets from crated mothers are more [susceptible](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/21/21-468/233519/20220815153028184_21-468_Amicus%20Brief.pdf) to infection than piglets from group-housed mothers. 
- Piglets from group-housed mothers have [better](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S175173111300147X) resistance and are exposed to fewer pathogens.
- Pork is the largest perpetrator of food-borne illnesses, with 787,000 infections per year.
- Salmonella from pork consumption alone costs Americans [$1.9 billion](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-animal-013120-043304) per year.
- [60 percent](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-animal-013120-043304) of mother pigs test positive for salmonella, and [10 percent](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-animal-013120-043304) are resistant to multiple drugs. 
- [27.1 percent](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/antimicrobial-stewardship/report-us-pigs-consume-nearly-many-antibiotics-people-do) of all antibiotics sold in the U.S. go to pork production.
- Roughly [700,000](https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/341666/9789240027336-eng.pdf) deaths annually can be connected to diseases that have become hard to combat due to antibiotic resistance—the number could surge to 10,000,000 by 2050.
