One critique of welfare campaigns is that they reduce the urgency of the issue in people's minds. I can see how that might be the case but I can also see the opposite case, which is that it puts something on people's moral radar, leading to the likelihood of them accepting more extreme asks in the future.  Giving women the right to vote didn't reduce the urgency of the problem of sexism. Allowing gay people to marry didn't reduce the urgency of homophobia in people's eyes. Then again, many people do dismiss modern day sexism by arguing that "women technically have equal rights in all ways". 

Another critique is that welfare campaigns legitimise animal agriculture by pretending that the problems can be resolved with changes to the system rather than an overhaul of the whole system.
