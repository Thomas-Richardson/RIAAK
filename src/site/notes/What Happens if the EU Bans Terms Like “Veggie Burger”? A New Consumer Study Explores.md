While the EU is discussing banning terms like “veggie burger” or “soy sausage”, [new data from Appinio](https://research.appinio.com/#/en/survey/gated/rJbHbxY0t?boardId=68f7a0a14f8ec9786ea1c3b6) provides a surprising insight: It’s not the name that causes confusion, and for German consumers, there are completely different priorities.

In a flash test where the packaging was viewed for only one second, 95 percent of respondents immediately recognized whether they were looking at a meat product or a plant-based alternative. Nevertheless, almost a third admitted to having accidentally picked up the wrong product in real life – and in both directions: vegans bought meat, and meat-eaters bought plant-based alternatives.

## Quickly recognized, yet still mistaken

The numbers show that the problem is not with the packaging but with the [supermarket shelves](https://vegconomist.com/topic/supermarkets/). The proximity of meat and plant-based alternatives leads to confusion; simply banning names would likely have little impact. Many see this as a sideshow. According to hundreds of open-text responses, many consumers view the name debate as unnecessary or just “symbolic politics.” The majority prefer to see a focus on more urgent societal issues.

The study reveals clear differences based on dietary style, region, gender, and age. Vegans and vegetarians are particularly likely to oppose the ban, while meat-eaters support it more frequently. The rejection is especially strong among urban and younger demographics, while older and rural participants show more support.

There are also nuances by gender. Men tend to view the decision more positively on average, while women are generally more critical. Overall, a clear pattern emerges. The ban divides along lifestyle, generation, gender, and living environment.

## What’s in a name?

If the EU does implement the regulation, people already have their favorites: The made-up word “Vurst” is the most popular alternative among 600 open-text suggestions. However, three-quarters of respondents didn’t have a suggestion at all, as the issue plays a minor role in everyday life.

## Methodology behind the survey

For the study, Appinio surveyed 1,208 people nationwide in [Germany](https://vegconomist.com/region/europe/germany/) in October 2025, representing the population by age, gender, and region. In addition to classic survey questions, a flash test was used. Participants were shown different packaging for meat and for 1 second to measure spontaneous recognition and categorization.

The study also assessed actual shopping behavior, opinions on the planned EU ban, and name alternatives for plant-based products, complemented by open-ended questions. The analysis provides a comprehensive picture of how consumers deal with product names and selection in everyday life, especially under time pressure.
