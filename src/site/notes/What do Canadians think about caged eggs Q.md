Bryant [did a report](https://bryantresearch.co.uk/insight-items/end-cage-confinement/) on 1000 canadians. Only 12% of them correctly suspected that > 75% of hens are caged. Estimates of the true portion of egg-laying hens in cages include range from [71%](https://spca.bc.ca/news/achieving-higher-welfare-for-hens/) to [90%](https://humanecanada.ca/about-us/media/canadas-battery-cage-phase-out-officially-begins/), with the most recent estimate at estimating [83%](https://sentientmedia.org/enriched-versus-cage-free-eggs/).
