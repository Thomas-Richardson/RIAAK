Send to Compassion in World farming for review.

- This is UK specific
- The media use both terms
- Factory farms have high stocking densities and cramped conditions
	- A common condition is that animals are kept inside their whole lives. In the UK this is sometimes called "zero grazing".
	- We can't get good information on the % of animals kept under various stocking densities, but can get data on % of animals kept inside for large amounts of their lives.
- Mega farms are defined by size: either we use the DEFRA permit system or the US definition of a CAFO:
	- cows: 700 dairy or 1000 beef
- For cows there isn't a difference
- Estimates of % of pigs on mega farms and factory farms differ a lot.
- The distinction matters: only mega farms are tracked by DEFRA. It is very hard to find good data on factory farms.
- We don't really know how many 
- All megafarms are probably factory farms, but not all factory farms are mega farms.


For pigs, we have 1.3M/5.1M pigs (2022 numbers) on EPR farms that's 25.5% [[Citations/World animal protection, 2024\|WAP 2024, P28]]
```math
1.3/5.1
4781015/((4575334/0.96)+(205,691/.6))
```

However, [96% of fattening (aka "finishing") pigs](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1166187/structure-june-uktimeseries-28jun23.ods) and [60% of breeding sows](https://www.daera-ni.gov.uk/sites/default/files/publications/daera/Agricultural%20Census%202022%20Publication_1.pdf) are kept in conditions we might describe as factory farm conditions: sows kept in farrowing crates for 5 weeks of every pregnancy, so a quarter of the year.

For broilers we have 85-95% on factory farms 

For layers "defra data" suggests 23% enriched cages, 13% in barns and the other 64% free range (WAP 2024, p35). 

WAP 2024 p27 say that 96.5% of poultry meat production in 2023 came from non-free range.
