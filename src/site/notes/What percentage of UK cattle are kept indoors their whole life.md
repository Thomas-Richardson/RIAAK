This is called "zero-grazing" or "continuous housing"
Bear in mind that % of herds is not the same as percentage of cows, because larger herds ar emore likely to house indoors. 
- [A 2019 voluntary survey](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5d78fb30ed915d522e416488/Cattle_Farm_practices_survey_April_2019-12sep19.pdf) of 1,363 english cattle farmers selected for TB risk (as the survey was primarily about that) finds 4%
	- 8% for larger herds over 150 cattle, 3% for smaller herds.
- [A guardian article](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/apr/03/they-dont-belong-in-concrete-shed-cows-still-happiest-outside) from 2021, with no source claims 20%+
- The [animal welfare committee](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/602e4d89d3bf7f72154fab78/awc-opinion-welfare-of-cattle-in-different-production-systems.pdf) reported that 2018/2019 AHDB claim 6% for dairy
	- Among the 95% of UK dairy herds that graze, approximately 7% do sofor over 9 months a year, 65% for 6–9 months, 20% for 3–6 months and 3% for fewer than 3 months
- It is likely to be less for beef herds because the milk system is thought to be conducive to being indoors all the time (from an efficiency perspective)
- However, bulls for the dairy industry are nearly always kept in 'bull pens' which basically means kept inside, often on their own, whenever they're not breeding.
- [A BBC freedom of information request](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cy4ldkpz1klo) (reported August 2024) details:
	- 141,000 cattle in Northern Ireland on large cattle farms (over 700) across 141 farms
	- 915,000 across Great Britain across 802 farms (average of 1,140 per farm)
	- That's 1,056,000 kept in large farms

```math
9,631,892-1,056,000
(1,056,000*0.1)+(8,575,892*0.04)
448,635.68/9,631,892
802+141
