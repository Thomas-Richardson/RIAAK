## Key source: https://ourworldindata.org/hunger-and-undernourishment
Hunger – also known as undernourishment – is defined as not consuming enough calories to maintain a normal, active, healthy life. Undernourishment is solely determined by the sufficiency of energy (calorie) intake. It does not consider the quality or diversity of someone’s diet.
