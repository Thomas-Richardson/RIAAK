Here is the API specification so I would just chuck this into Claude's code and it should be able to figure some stuff out: https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/user-guides/data-browser/api-data-access/api-detailed-guidelines/sdmx3-0/data-query

Eurostat also publishes EU-wide food production data: **Eurostat Agricultural Production**
**"Slaughtering in slaughterhouses"** or **"Meat Production"** datasets. Because Eurostat stopped publishing direct "Meat Consumption" stats around 2018, economists now have to calculate it themselves using production and trade data.

- **Dataset Code:** `apro_mt_pann` (Annual Meat Production) or `apro_mt_pjan` (Monthly).
- **Dataset Name:** Slaughtering in slaughterhouses - annual data.
- **Link:** [Eurostat Data Browser - Slaughtering in slaughterhouses](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/apro_mt_pann/default/table%3Flang%3Den)
- downside is that 

Probably better than FAOStat
