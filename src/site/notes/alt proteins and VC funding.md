- In its infancy, much of the sector focused on plant-based CPG products
- Timelines to bring those products to market were a reasonably good fit with VC expectations. The risk was often moderate, early consumer adoption was promising, and there was demonstrated interest from retail and foodservice
- As alternative protein food and ingredient startups mature, it is now clear that traditional pools of capital will become insufficient for timely commercialization.
- VC timelines and expectations are often not well-aligned with those of advanced precision fermentation and cultivated meat companies, as those startups can take longer to deliver returns than less technologically complex ventures (i.e., plant-based CPG startups). Private equity favors established companies with track records of steady cash flows. And commercial banks are typically too risk-averse to provide loans for cutting-edge alternative protein innovation.
- A study by GFI concluded that the plant-based meat industry alone will require $27 billion in cumulative capital spending by 2030 to garner just a 6% share of animal products. This would need to be supplemented with $17 billion in annual operating costs
- This is to say nothing of requirements for fermentation and cultivated products, likely to be even higher.

[[BSG, 2022\|BSG, 2022]]: Venture capital in alternative proteins grew from $1 billion in 2019 to $5 billion in 2021. Investment in fermentation-based and animal-cell-based technologies saw significant rises of 137% and 425%, respectively.
