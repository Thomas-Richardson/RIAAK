Bioaerosols contain a range of microorganisms and their components, including:
- **Fungi**: Both living and dead fungi are common components of bioaerosols.
- **Bacteria**: Pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacteria can be found in bioaerosols.
- **Endotoxin**: These are toxins released from the cell walls of certain bacteria.
- **Mycotoxins**: Toxic compounds produced by molds.
- **Allergens**: Substances that can trigger allergic reactions in some individuals
