## Euro doctors alarmed over meat consumption - survey

17

September

2025

European healthcare professionals think we’re eating too much meat.

Nine out of ten doctors and dieticians across five European countries think average meat consumption in Europe already exceeds healthy levels. That’s one of the findings from our new survey, released today.

The survey, carried out by Marlin Research, polled 600 healthcare professionals in the UK, Germany, France, Spain and Italy.

The results paint a picture of a profession concerned about the impact of meat overconsumption on both individuals’ health and healthcare, and strong support for reforming the food system and tackling the overconsumption of meat.

Vicky Bond, Madre Brava’s CEO, said: “Healthcare professionals across Europe are clearly gravely concerned that people are eating too much meat. This overconsumption means people are getting sick from preventable diseases like heart disease and cancer, and struggling unnecessarily with poor health.”

  
Among those polled, there was near-unanimous (92%) agreement that diets high in red and processed meat are linked to cancer, heart disease and (90%) contribute to increased spending on already stretched healthcare systems.

Eighty-four per cent of the healthcare professionals who took part in the survey agreed that overall meat consumption is a public health concern needing food system reform.

The findings also expose deep unease about industry power. Over 70% of respondents said the meat industry undermines scientific evidence, and almost 90% believe large food companies exert too much influence over national food policy.

There was widespread agreement among the healthcare professionals surveyed around some of the potential solutions to Europe’s overconsumption of meat, with support for system-level changes.

A staggering 95% of those surveyed called for health warnings on red and processed meat.

An overwhelming majority (87%) said public places like schools and hospitals should serve less meat.

And 82% of respondents said governments are failing to invest enough in promoting plant-rich diets as a foundation of public health.

In January of this year, a large number of civil society organisations, including health charities, [came together to call](https://eeb.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Joint_call_EU_Action_Plan_for_Plant-Based_Foods_Jan2025.pdf) for an EU Action Plan on Plant-based Foods. They claimed current policies and efforts were not sufficient to bring about the much-needed shift to a more sustainable and efficient food system at the production and processing level and called for a coherent plan from the European Commission.

Denmark is one of the leaders in this regard, with its own [action plan on plant-based foods](https://en.fvm.dk/Media/638484294982868221/Danish-Action-Plan-for-Plant-based-Foods.pdf), which it published in October 2023, proving that, with political will and vision, governments can support the health of their populations by helping create a food system that makes healthy choices easier for consumers.

Vicky added: “We need action, both from the supermarkets shaping our food systems, and from governments, to rebalance our diets. This includes adding more plant proteins to the mix.

“It’s not about cutting out meat entirely, but health professionals are seeing how essential it is for us to eat much less meat and have more plant-rich diets for the sake of our health.”

### Country Spotlight

**Italy**: Support for warnings on red and processed meat is lower than in other countries. Only 72% of Italian doctors and dietitians said current meat consumption is a public health concern, compared with over 80% elsewhere. By contrast, 80% of Italian respondents want new or updated dietary guidelines, the highest support of any country.

**Germany**: A staggering 98% of those surveyed believed red and processed meat should carry health warnings.

**UK**: Healthcare professionals reported the highest levels of concern and agreement across questions on health risks and healthcare costs when it comes to meat consumption.

**France and Spain**: Both countries broadly mirrored the UK and Germany, with strong backing for health warnings and for public institutions to cut meat from menus.

The survey, conducted by Marlin Research between 31 July and 25 August 2025, interviewed 300 doctors and specialists and 300 dieticians across five countries. The survey was conducted online via computer assisted web based interviewing (CAWI). The views presented here do not reflect the views of Marlin Research or any related entity.
