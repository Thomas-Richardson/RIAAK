- Our food system as a whole accounts for 1/3 of our total GHG emissions ([[Citations/Crippa et al., 2021\|Crippa et al., 2021]])
	- 60% of that comes from meat and dairy, despite them providing just 18% of calories and 37% of protein ([[Citations/Poore and Nemecek 2018\|Poore and Nemecek 2018]]))
	- 32-40% of annual human-caused methane (CH4) emissions come from animal agriculture. [^4] [^5]

- A consequence of this is that [[Modest meat reduction can have significant environmental benefits\|Modest meat reduction can have significant environmental benefits]]
- Conversely, [[Better livestock practices will not offset emissions from livestock\|Better livestock practices will not offset emissions from livestock]]
	
livestock farming is the largest source of human-caused methane emissions, accounting for [32% of the total](https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/methane-emissions-are-driving-climate-change-heres-how-reduce-them) and 0.5°C of warming since pre-industrial times. Animal farming [accounts for 78%](https://www.globalcarbonproject.org/methanebudget/20/files/MethaneInfographic2020.png) of agricultural methane emissions

## Livestock emission % by animal
Cattle are 65% of the livestock sector's emissions, evenly split between beef and dairy cattle. Pigs, poultry, buffaloes and small ruminants have much lower emission levels, with each representing between 7 and 10 percent of sector emissions[^1]

If cattle were able to form their own country, they would rank 3rd behind China and the United States among the world’s largest greenhouse gas emitters.[^2] [^3]
- China (2019): 12.1 billion tonnes CO2e
- United States (2019): 5.8 billion tonnes CO2e
- Cattle (~2010): 5.0 billion tonnes CO2e
