## Food bourne illness is a big problem
[The Safe Food Imperative](https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/agriculture/publication/the-safe-food-imperative-accelerating-progress-in-low-and-middle-income-countries) estimated the cost of foodborne diseases (FBD) at USD$110 billion in lost productivity and medical expenses in low- and middle-income countries each year.

They can be caused by a variety of microbial pathogens, chemicals, and parasites that contaminate food.
The most common bacteria responsible for asf based food poisoning are:
Some key pathogens that cause food poisoning from animal products include:

- **Salmonella**: Salmonella bacteria are a common cause of foodborne illness, often associated with poultry and eggs[4][5].
- **Staphylococcus aureus**: This bacterium is responsible for a significant number of food poisoning cases and is commonly found on raw foods like meat products[2].
- **Clostridium perfringens**: Another common cause of foodborne illness, often linked to contamination of raw meat and poultry products[2][5].
- **Campylobacter**: This bacterium can cause diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and nausea and is commonly found in meat, poultry, milk, and mushrooms[2][5].
- **Listeria monocytogenes**: Listeria can survive adverse conditions for long periods and is associated with foods like milk, soft cheeses, and vegetables fertilized with manure[2].

- Some estimates of the burden of disease from food bourne illness places it as high as HIV/AIDS, malaria, or tuberculosis [^1] 
- A 9-country study found that 25% of stunting could be attributed to experiencing more than four episodes of diarrhea before the age of 24 mo (Checkley et al., 2008), and Rogawski et al., 2018[^7] found that episodes of diarrhoea from Campylobacter, E-coli and Shigella infections (asfs are common sources of these infections) had significant effects on stunting and growth of infants.

## ASFs are a huge part of the problem
- A great review found that in #lower_middle_income_countries, ([Grace, 2015](https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/12/9/10490) )
- [6% of Pork](https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/11/1/403) in Nagaland, NE India met safe food standards[^3]
- [Only 2%](https://cgspace.cgiar.org/collections/5c578e47-978e-41d4-a680-9a6372b1441a) of meat samples in Nigeria complied with standards[^4]
- [0% of milk samples in Assam](https://cgspace.cgiar.org/server/api/core/bitstreams/5296819c-18bb-4662-9a82-690536b31c7a/content) complied with standard[^5]
- [A study of 48 countries](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1478-7954-10-5) found that high levels of meat production was a key predictor of death rate from food-bourne illness[^6]
- [Out of 821 USDA-inspected poultry slaughterhouses, 390 (47.5%) failed to meet federal Salmonella performance standards between 2017 and 2018.](https://sentientmedia.org/nearly-half-of-poultry-slaughterhouses-fail-usda-salmonella-inspections/) The worst offenders had Salmonella rates over 25%.

[Grace et al., (2020)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022030220307773) estimates that dairy may be responsible for 4% of the global food-bourne disease burden and 12% of the ASF disease burden.

## Notes
- ASF account for approximately 35% of the total burden of foodborne diseases caused by all food groups.
- Specific pathogens of interest, in terms of ASF, included non-typhoidal Salmonella, Campylobacter and Taenia Solium. Together, these three pathogens account for 70% of the total global burden associated with ASF.
- While ASF are valuable sources of nutrients that can prevent stunting in small children, they are also a key cause of diarrhoea which is the strongest predictor of stunting.
- Mycobacterium bovis (the causative agent of tuberculosis in cattle) is still an important burden in Africa, and causes most food bourne disease from dairy in Africa
- Very little foreign aid to tackle food bourne disease
- Approximately 90% of the FBD burden of _Campylobacter_ spp. was attributed to ASF, a disease which is [among the most important pathogens](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(18)30349-8/fulltext) associated with Environmental Enteric Dysfunction and stunting.
