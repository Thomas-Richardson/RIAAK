## How does grass fed beef compare to other foods?
A 100g serving of grass-fed ground beef [has about 0.071 grams of omega-3 fatty acids](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/168608/nutrients), according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s [National Nutrient Database](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/).  This means that a 100g contains around 6.5% of the female RDA and 4.4% of the male RDA. A burger might be up to 180g so that would be 11.6% of a womans, or 7.9% of mans allowance.

Compared to this, 100g of Walnuts contains 6.2g of Omega 3[^6], or 560% of a womans RDA (387% of a males'). This is almost 100 times more than grass fed beef by weight. Our large grass fed beef burger above contains as much as 2g of walnuts, which is less than a single walnut half.

Hamilton et al., [2005](https://d1wqtxts1xzle7.cloudfront.net/39205296/00463513f580184d24000000-libre.pdf?1444915064=&response-content-disposition=inline%3B+filename%3DLipid_Composition_and_Contaminants_in_Fa.pdf&Expires=1691235235&Signature=FOJcS2q-UNwfJjMzhifbUiXxGcB2ohKWMkB19RlAkjoqtNWcGOtYHgbzItf6U0hR68OQlOs1PLwJwHknWS~wwVs2ZVIuHrJkPaaTQfVyruyexoIvv2qP7NJDarKLEI1Mw~IJnrDhM6eDDYoZI4YHt40sL9KfxxgTLQrZKSx2-9Br3M2hu2AIzSJRpn93Disx4yDcVZNhy9GX9W180rwsY0E3v2zaKagmbE~cyeR6ozWig3GOojBDKMR47ggQFdDrI7vGaXOeSEHd~PgOF2ENcrABb3OKM567YB2h6yatE795fKQv8p~XYJ~2n3-ckngH-RDtzFLtccagLHnkqmk5~A__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAJLOHF5GGSLRBV4ZA) [^3] found that the n-3:n-6 was about 10 in wild salmon and 3-4 in farmed salmon. A 100g portion of wild salmon contained 1.2g of n3, and 0.1g of n6, whereas farmed contained more of both: 100g farmed salmon contained 3.3g n3 and 0.9g of n6. 

For comparison, a tablespoon of canola oil (approximately 14 grams of canola oil) contains 1.28 g of ALA.

2.57g per ounce aka per 28g aka per 11.6 walnut halves, aka 0.22

Additionally, while grass fed beef can contain around 50% more Omega 3 fatty acids than grain fed, a standard portion contains only (65/1600)\*100 =4% (Source) of the recommended female daily allowance. For context, a single walnut half contains 3 times this amount at 185mg. The comparison of omega 3 and 6 fatty acids between grass and grain-fed beef has no practical relevance to human health.
