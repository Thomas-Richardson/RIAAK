Dairy is probably not good for weight loss in HICs [[Citations/Schwingshackl et al., 2016\|Schwingshackl et al., 2016]], However this meta analysis[^1] reviewed 17 studies and found that dairy consumption seems to descrease risk of obesity with quite strong effect

Schwingshackl et al., 2017a found that above 600g per day dairy was associated with all cause mortality (27 studies, 126000 death cases). But that's a lot of dairy. A yoghurt weighs 100g, a block of violife 200g
