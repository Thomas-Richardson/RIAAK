Dairy is probably not good for weight loss in HICs [[Citations/Schwingshackl et al., 2016\|Schwingshackl et al., 2016]], However this meta analysis[^1] reviewed 17 studies and found that dairy consumption seems to decrease risk of obesity with quite strong effect

[[Citations/Neuenschwander et al., 2023\|Neuenschwander et al., 2023]] found swapping butter for olive oil reduced CVD, and replacing dairy for nuts reduced all cause morality

[[Citations/Schwingshackl et al., 2017a\|Schwingshackl et al., 2017a]] found that above 600g per day dairy was associated with all cause mortality (27 studies, 126000 death cases). But that's a lot of dairy. A yoghurt weighs 100g, a block of violife 200g
