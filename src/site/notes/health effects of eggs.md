- [[Citations/Kwok et al., 2019\|Kwok et al., 2019]] in a comprehensive review found inconclusive evidence for eggs on CVD and all cause mortality
- [[Citations/Schwingshackl et al., 2017b\|Schwingshackl et al., 2017b]] Moderate evidence that eggs increase t2d rates
- [[Citations/Schwingshackl et al., 2017c\|Schwingshackl et al., 2017c]] *might* have something to say about eggs, read the paper
- [[Citations/Neuenschwander et al., 2023\|Neuenschwander et al., 2023]] finds
	- Swapping eggs with nuts reduces CVD

- In [[Citations/Schwingshackl et al., 2017a\|Schwingshackl et al., 2017a]] They found that we're generally uncertain about effects of eggs on all cause mortality, but there is probably risk that increases once you get above 50g eggs a day, which is about a medium egg. (Eight studies with 30,352 mortalities). They also found that larger studies over 1000 deaths tended to show negative effects of eggs
