In 2015, the cancer agency of the World Health Organization, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), classified the consumption of red meat, which includes beef, lamb, and pork, as carcinogenic to humans if eaten in processed form, and as probably carcinogenic if eaten unprocessed[^1].
## Risk ratios for red and processed meat and cancer

Pulling extensively from [[Citations/Farvid et al., 2021\|Farvid et al., 2021]] which details at the individual cancer level

[[Citations/Han et al., 2019\|Han et al., 2019]] found small RRs

[[Citations/Wang et al., 2016\|Wang et al., 2016]] found across 3 studies, cancer mortality increase associated with 100g more unprocessed meat (RR = 1·12, 95 % CI 1·07, 1·17; P = 0·001). across 5 studies the risk ratios for cancer mortality associated with 50g per day of processed meat was 1.08 (95% CI 1.06-1.11)
