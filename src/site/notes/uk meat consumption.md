Recent paper I haven't read: https://www.nature.com/articles/s43016-024-01070-2

Whilst widely cited [[Citations/Stewart et al., 2021\|Stewart et al., 2021]] shows a large decline in meat consumption between 2008 and 2019, [[Citations/Smith, Scheebeek, Balmford and Garnett, 2021\|Smith, Scheebeek, Balmford and Garnett, 2021]] use other data to show a lot of that reduction might be driven by lying about meat consumption. [Household budget surveys](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/family-food-statistics) show just a 3% decline (-4.6 g) in meat purchases in the UK from 2008 to 2019. Given huge differences in raw amounts, ==it's very hard to know just how much meat people are eating==.

Underreporting seems to be [increasing over time](https://www.bi.team/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/16-07-12-Counting-Calories-Final.pdf). This could be the result of many factors, but [some studies](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17433123/) have found that underreporting is significantly higher in overweight and obese individuals. According to the Office for National Statistics, the National Diet and Nutrition Survey may have underestimated calorie intake [by as much as 34%](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/methodologies/agovernmentstatisticalserviceperspectiveonofficialestimatesofcalorieconsumption2019update) in 2019.
